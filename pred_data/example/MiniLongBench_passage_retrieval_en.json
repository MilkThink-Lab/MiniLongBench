Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: Although McCartney was promoting Driving Rain, the majority of his shows would be celebrations of his past, with a substantial sampling of his solo work with and without Wings, but in particular his Beatles hits, and it was the release of those particular songs on Back in the US that sparked one of McCartney's biggest controversies in ages. Despite keeping the famous Lennon–McCartney credit intact on Tripping the Live Fantastic, Unplugged (The Official Bootleg) and Paul Is Live, McCartney decided to reverse the credits to \"Paul McCartney and John Lennon\" much to Yoko Ono's public annoyance. Reportedly, McCartney had decided to act in response to Ono's recent dropping of his credit from \"Give Peace a Chance\" on Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon in 1997. While there continues to be division among critics and fans over McCartney's move, John Lennon never publicly objected to the original credit reversal that appeared on 1976's Wings over America, four years before Lennon's death. Undeterred by Ono's anger, McCartney swapped the credits again on Back in the World in 2003.\n\nParagraph 2: In the United States Congress, a joint resolution is a legislative measure that requires passage by the Senate and the House of Representatives and is presented to the President for their approval or disapproval. Generally, there is no legal difference between a joint resolution and a bill. Both must be passed, in exactly the same form, by both chambers of Congress, and signed by the President (or, re-passed in override of a presidential veto; or, remain unsigned for ten days while Congress is in session) to become a law. Only joint resolutions may be used to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, and these do not require the approval of the President. Laws enacted by joint resolutions are not distinguished from laws enacted by bills, except that they are designated as resolutions as opposed to Acts of Congress (see for example War Powers Resolution).\n\nParagraph 3: He graduated from Yale University in 1912, after having been voted \"most brilliant\" in his class. He briefly attended Harvard Law School but dropped out on the death of his father in 1914. At Yale, he was a member of Scroll and Key. In 1914, Bullitt was travelling though Russia with his mother and was in Moscow on 28 July 1914 when the Austrian empire declared war on Serbia, provoking pro-Serb demonstrations on the streets. Bullitt took the last train from Moscow to Berlin and left Russia very shorty before Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914. Upon his return to America, Bullitt worked as a journalist for the Philadelphia Ledger and become the deputy editor of the paper in 1915. In December 1915, in a publicity stunt, Henry Ford chartered an ocean liner, which he called the \"peace ship\" and sailed to Europe with the intention of mediating an end to the First World War. Bullitt was one of the journalists abroad the \"peace ship\" and he filed satirical reports from the ship about the resulting media circus, which stressed the absurdity of Ford's voyage, which were published on the front pages of various American newspapers.    \n\nParagraph 4: When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in \"The Body\", saying \"They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy.\" Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was \"truly groundbreaking\"; no long speech, no huge discovery: \"Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world\". Tropiano calls it \"A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do.\"  Shortly before the end of the scene, while Xander is talking, Willow can be seen silently mouthing \"I love you\" to Tara.\n\nParagraph 5: Vinay visits Gangtok, and meets another Amar associate, Neena. He promises to help her escape the gang in return for information. Neena, however, gets Vinay captured by luring him into the gang's safehouse. The gang's real leader is revealed to be Arjun, who is the jewel thief. No person named Amar ever existed; the identity was created to baffle the police and deflect any attention away from Arjun. Vishambhar Nath was part of this carefully planned scheme, too, while Shalini had assisted the gang to secure the release of her kidnapped brother, Shishu. When she approaches Arjun for Shishu's release, she gets locked up with him in the safehouse. Having discovered secret passages under the building, Shalini rescues Vinay and explains the situation to him. The three try to flee, but are recaptured. Vinay is administered electric shocks to wipe out his memory. The gang then make Vinay believe that 'jewel thief Amar' is his real identity. Their plan is to stage a fake heist of the Sikkimese crown jewels, and let 'Amar' take the blame. The police will be manipulated into shooting 'Amar' dead, forever lifting suspicion from the actual criminals. Since Shalini is a well-known dancer in the royal court, she is to facilitate the gang's entry disguised as a dance troupe. 'Amar' dies according to plan, and the gang celebrates. Vinay, however, had merely been acting; he had secretly warned the police about the gang's plan beforehand. Anjali, who has discovered her father's criminal involvement, has got in touch with the police too. The police surround the safehouse and Vinay corners Arjun, but he manages to escape. Vinay follows Arjun to his plane, but the latter threatens to shoot him. Anjali, though, has already removed the bullets in the gun, and the Commissioner appears to announce that the entire gang has been arrested, before January 26 as promised. Anjali takes Vinay to the cabin where Shalini is waiting for him with Shishu, as the plane gets airborne.\n\nParagraph 6: It is a tree reaching 30 meters in height. The young, gray to dark brown branches are sparsely hairy, but become hairless when mature. The branches have sparse lenticels. Its elliptical, slightly leathery to leathery leaves are 14–31.5 by 5-13 centimeters. The leaves have wedge-shaped to rounded bases and tapering tips, with the tapering portion 4-18 millimeters long. The leaves are hairless on their upper surfaces and sparsely hairy on their lower surfaces. The leaves have 10-20 pairs of secondary veins emanating from their midribs. Its sparsely to densely hairy petioles are 6-15 by 1.5-3.5 millimeters with a broad groove on their upper side. Its Inflorescences occur in clusters of 5–8 on branches, and are organized on indistinct peduncles. Each inflorescence has 1-2 flowers. Each flower is on a densely hairy pedicel that is 13-32 by 0.3-0.9 millimeters. The pedicels are organized on a rachis up to 5 millimeters long that have up to 2 bracts. The pedicels have a medial, very densely hairy bract that is 0.5-2 millimeters long. Its flowers are unisexual. Its flowers have 3 oval sepals, that are 1-2 by 1.5-3 millimeters and partially fused at their bases. The sepals are hairless on their upper surface, densely hairy on their lower surface, and hairy at their margins. Its 6 petals are arranged in two rows of 3. The cream-colored, oval to elliptical, outer petals are 2.5-4.5 by 2.5-5 millimeters with hairless upper surfaces and densely hairy lower surfaces. The light yellow to golden yellow, diamond-shaped inner petals have a 2-8 millimeter long claw at their base and a 3-11 by 2-5 millimeter blade. The inner petals have pointed bases and tips. The inner petals are slightly hairy on their upper surfaces, and very densely hairy on their lower surfaces. The inner petals have a solitary, butterfly-shaped, smooth, raised gland on their upper surfact. Male flowers have 30-42 stamens that are 0.5-0.9 by 0.6-1 millimeters. Female flowers have 8-9 carpels that are 1-2 by 2.5-3.5 millimeters.  Each carpel has 5-7 ovules arranged in two rows. The female flowers have 10-13 sterile stamens. The fruit occur in clusters of up to 5 on slightly hairy pedicles that are 10-35 by 1.5-4.5 millimeters. The brown, elliptical fruit are 18-46 by 10-31 millimeters. The fruit are wrinkly, and very densely hairy. Each fruit has 4-7 hemi-spherical to lens-shaped seeds that are 10–14.5 by 7-10 by 4-8 millimeters and are arranged in two rows.  The seeds are wrinkly.\n\nParagraph 7: At the Restoration the Privy Council established a force of several infantry regiments and a few troops of horse and there were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerrilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after the introduction of the socket bayonet disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,000 men in various regiments and another 268 veterans in the major garrison towns. After the Glorious Revolution the Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars, beginning with the Nine Years' War in Flanders (1689–97). Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment by English men of war, but a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs during the second half of the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime. In the Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) between 80 and 120 captains, took Scottish letters of marque and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict. In the 1690s a small fleet of five ships was established by merchants for the Darien Scheme, and a professional navy was established for the protection of commerce in home waters during the Nine Years' War, with three purpose-built warships bought from English shipbuilders in 1696. After the Act of Union in 1707, these vessels were transferred to the Royal Navy. By the time of the Act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a standing army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling. As part of the British Army, Scottish regiments took part in the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20), wars with Spain (1727–29) and (1738–48) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48). The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch in 1740, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite rising. The bulk of Jacobite armies were made up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. The clan gentlemen formed the front ranks of the unit and were more heavily armed than their impoverished tenants who made up the bulk of the regiment. Because they served in the front ranks, the gentlemen suffered higher proportional casualties than the common clansman. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed, but arms tended to become more conventional as the campaigns progressed.\n\nParagraph 8: As the school expanded and added a secondary school, it moved into a new building at 66 Bond Street, which was designed by the ecclesiastical architect James Haffa and opened in 1950. In 1955, the school was granted affiliation with the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music, becoming one of six choirs and choir schools in the world to share this affiliation. The affiliation authorized St. Michael's Choir School to grant the degree of Bachelor of Sacred Music, with a specialization in Gregorian chant. In 1966, St. Michael's Choir School entered into an agreement with the Toronto Catholic District School Board, then called the Metropolitan Separate School Board, to place secular, non-music courses under the publicly funded Catholic school system. In 1975, the secondary school expanded further and moved to 69 Bond Street. By 1987, the school was fully funded by government with the exception of its music program, for which students continue to pay fees. In 1987, St. Michael's Choir School celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, and in recognition of this milestone, Toronto mayor Art Eggleton declared June 15, 1987 as the official \"St. Michael's Choir School Day.\" In 1996, the elementary school moved into a renovated building at 67 Bond Street and left 66 Bond Street as an administrative building, auditorium, and rehearsal space for the school's music division.\n\nParagraph 9: The International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum is a program offering at Springbrook. It includes the Middle Years Program, featuring a Personal Project, for 9th and 10th graders, and the IB Diploma Program for 11th and 12th graders. In addition, Springbrook offers an Advanced Placement (AP) program. Students may start taking AP courses as early as their freshman year with AP U.S. History. As of 2022, The AP participation rate at Springbrook is 75%. Springbrook is one of the 25 Maryland high schools that sends the most students to the University of Maryland's Clark School of Engineering, the only NEC high school included in that list.\n\nParagraph 10: When the first proteins were rationally designed during the 1970s and 1980s, the sequence for these was optimized manually based on analyses of other known proteins, the sequence composition, amino acid charges, and the geometry of the desired structure. The first designed proteins are attributed to Bernd Gutte, who designed a reduced version of a known catalyst, bovine ribonuclease, and tertiary structures consisting of beta-sheets and alpha-helices, including a binder of DDT. Urry and colleagues later designed elastin-like fibrous peptides based on rules on sequence composition. Richardson and coworkers designed a 79-residue protein with no sequence homology to a known protein. In the 1990s, the advent of powerful computers, libraries of amino acid conformations, and force fields developed mainly for molecular dynamics simulations enabled the development of structure-based computational protein design tools. Following the development of these computational tools, great success has been achieved over the last 30 years in protein design. The first protein successfully designed completely de novo was done by Stephen Mayo and coworkers in 1997, and, shortly after, in 1999 Peter S. Kim and coworkers designed dimers, trimers, and tetramers of unnatural right-handed coiled coils. In 2003, David Baker's laboratory designed a full protein to a fold never seen before in nature. Later, in 2008, Baker's group computationally designed enzymes for two different reactions. In 2010, one of the most powerful broadly neutralizing antibodies was isolated from patient serum using a computationally designed protein probe. Due to these and other successes (e.g., see examples below), protein design has become one of the most important tools available for protein engineering. There is great hope that the design of new proteins, small and large, will have uses in biomedicine and bioengineering.\n\nParagraph 11: In 2001, Ai Takahashi joined the Japanese idol group Morning Musume as part of the group's fifth generation of performers, along with Makoto Ogawa, Asami Konno, and Risa Niigaki. Her audition involved a three-day training camp where participants were expected to learn a new song, a dance routine and a script. Takahashi was one of nine applicants selected out of 25,000 for the camp. Her debut with the group was on their single \"Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band\", and her first appearance on a Morning Musume full-length release was their fourth studio album, 4th Ikimasshoi!. Her first appearance within a Hello! Project shuffle unit release was on the 2002 single \"Shiawase Beam! Suki Suki Beam!\" under the group name Happy 7.\n\nParagraph 12: In October 2013, Williams was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary at Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). As communities minister, his responsibilities included community cohesion, race relations, localism and community rights, empty homes, housing standards, building regulations, neighbourhood planning, climate change and sustainable development. In March 2014, Williams published the Government's proposals following the housing standards review, which recommended a rationalisation of government, local authority and industry housing standards into a national set. As Minister for Communities, Williams also announced new funding for promotion of the Cornish language and gave recognition to the people of Cornwall as a national minority on the same basis as the other celtic people of the British Isles. In 2017, it emerged that Williams had responded to 2014 concerns from the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group about the fire safety of Britain's tower blocks, especially the absence of sprinklers in many of these, by saying, \"I have neither seen nor heard anything that would suggest that consideration of these specific potential changes is urgent and I am not willing to disrupt the work of this department by asking that these matters are brought forward.\" The correspondence was leaked to the BBC after the Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nParagraph 13: Stars with 40 percent the mass of the Sun and larger have non-convective cores with a strong temperature gradient from the centre outwards. When they exhaust hydrogen at the core of the star, the shell of hydrogen surrounding the central core continues to fuse without interruption.  The star is considered to be a subgiant at this point although there is little change visible from the exterior.  As the fusing hydrogen shell converts its mass into helium the convective effect separates the helium towards the core where it very slowly increases the mass of the non-fusing core of nearly pure helium plasma. As this takes place the fusing hydrogen shell gradually expands outward which increases the size of the outer shell of the star up to the subgiant size from two to ten times the original radius of the star when it was on the main sequence. The expansion of the outer layers of the star into the subgiant size nearly balances the increase energy generated by the hydrogen shell fusion causing the star to nearly maintain its surface temperature. This causes the spectral class of the star to change very little in the lower end of this range of star mass. The subgiant surface area radiating the energy is so much larger the potential circumstellar habitable zone where planetary orbits will be in the range to form liquid water is shifted much further out into any planetary system. The surface area of a sphere is found as 4πr2 so a sphere with a radius of  will release 400% as much energy at the surface and a sphere with a  will release 10000% as much energy.\n\nParagraph 14: Little information is known about Tehuelche culture before the use of the horse, although their socioeconomic organization resembled that of the Ona people from Tierra del Fuego. The introduction of the horse by the Spaniards, which they became acquainted with as of 1570, transformed the social organization of Tehuelche people: the introduction caused groups to develop dependencies on horses in their daily lives. Like the indigenous groups in the North American Great Plains, the Tehuelche also worked the thicket steppes of Patagonia, living mainly off of guanaco and rhea meat (ñandú or choique), followed by South Andean deer, deer, Patagonian mara and even puma and jaguar meat, in addition to certain plants (although late, they learned how to cultivate the land). As for fish and shellfish, there were certain cases where their consumption was banned: for example, some groups had prohibited the consumption of fish. Their groups used to consist of between 50 and 100 members.The adoption of the horse meant an extensive social change in Tehuelche culture: the new mobility altered their ancestral territories and greatly affected their movement patterns. Before the 17th century east–west movements prevailed in pursuit of guanacos; however, as of the dawn of the equestrian complex, longitudinal movements (from south to north and vice versa) were very important in establishing extensive exchange networks. In the mid-19th century the Aonikenk exchanged their skins and mollusks for cholilas (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, Magellan barberry, Chilean pine tree seeds, Cyttaria, buds and Chilean bamboo buds, etc.) and apples with the Gennakenk people of Neuquén, the upper valley of Río Negro and the so-called 'country of Strawberries', or Chulilaw (the region approximately bounded to the north by Lake Nahuel Huapi, to the east by the low mountains and morraines called Patagónides, to the west by the high summits of the Andes and to the south by Lake Buenos Aires/General Carrera).\n\nParagraph 15: Louis XIV's glory was irrevocably linked to two great projects, military conquest and the building of Versailles—both of which required enormous sums of money. To finance these projects, Louis created several additional tax systems, including the \"capitation\" (begun in 1695) which taxed every person including nobles and the clergy, though exemption could be bought for a large one-time sum, and the \"dixième\" (1710–1717, restarted in 1733), which was a true tax on income and on property value and was meant to support the military. The Taille remained the chief direct tax, but its weight fell differently depending on the fiscal status (généralité) of the province. The Pays d'états were at a great advantage because they paid the Taille Réelle, which was based on a fixed percentage of a property's value. The Pays d'élection enjoyed no such privileges, their taille rate was assessed behind closed doors by the Council of State, which raised the taille arbitrarily to try and close the widening government deficit. The differences in terms of material prosperity between the two types of province was noticeable. To exasperate the burden of the taille, it was levied quarterly rather than annually, and was a heavy burden on rural peasants, tending to fall heaviest on the poorest généralités and parishes. This acted as a disincentive on farmers to increase their productivity, since a larger yield was inevitably offset by a higher taille assessment.\n\nParagraph 16: 2019: SATISfashion - Metro West - Melbourne - Australia. 2017: qp – as part of the Fringe in The West – FCAC – Melbourne – Australia. 2016: MADATONG – Bromley Gallery – Windsor - Melbourne – Australia. 2015: SCRIPTA (Writings of the World) – as part of the Big West Festival – African Town – Footscray – Melbourne – Australia, [RE]alphabetika @Díli – Fundação Oriente – Díli – East Timor. 2014: Fandata - Fo Guang Yuan Art Gallery – Melbourne – Australia,  [Ex]Isle (Painted Tales) – As part of the Latin Festival - Ventana Fiesta - Frankston Arts Centre – Australia. 2012: CRIOLANTUS – PCIL - Cultural Palace – Praia – Cape Verde,  [RE]alphabetika @ Cascais - Parque Palmela – Cascais - Portugal,  Private Z(oo)M - Macau Literary Festival - Polytechnic Institute of Macao – Macao – China. 2011: Amor Sta La - Galeria da Ordem dos Médicos – Lisbon - Portugal, 10x9.11 - (with Binga de Castro) – The Music House - Praia – Cape Verde,  Pé Na Boti - Vídeo_Phonics Witnesses – CV Cultural House - Rotterdam - Netherlands,  Paredis & Numbrason (Collaboration with Ana Rita Pires) - CAC Tejo - V.V.Rodão – Portugal,  Private Z(oo)M - Tempo de Bichos - Afro-Brazil Museum - S.Paulo – Brazil.  2010: Majina - 30 anos 100 Lennon - Buchholz Bookstore – Lisbon – Portugal,  POEMix (Collaboration with Binga de Castro) – IILP (International Institute of Portuguese Language) - Praia - Cape Verde, Na Fai Minotu - UNICV (University of Cape Verde) - Praia - Cape Verde, De Pareidolia (Collaboration with Ana Rita Pires) - PCIL - Praia - Cape Verde. 2009: Nó di Sulada - WMDC (World Music and Dance Centre) - Rotterdam - Netherlands. 2008: Nu Bai – BCA - Atlantic Comercial Bank Auditorium - Praia - Cape Verde, FishBonEye - S.Vicente City Hall - Mindelo – Cape Verde.  2007: Na Som Di Kriolu – Expominas - Belo Horizonte – Brazil. 2006: Só Pamodi Bó (1 recordai pa Luís Morais) – Library Orlando Ribeiro – Lisbon – Portugal,  Li-Sim-Sim - Kerry Center - Beijing - China, Fisherman's Wharf - Macao – China. 2005: Dia Santo Na Lém Di Mulato – PCIL - Cultural Palace - Praia - Cape Verde, Promessa Di Marlargo - Mabooki Bookshop - Lisbon – Portugal. 2004: Timenti Lua Ka Subi - PCIL - Cultural Palace - Praia - Cape Verde. 2003: The Cape Verdean Blues (A Blue Note 4 HS) – National Library - Praia - Cape Verde.  2002: N' - Ler Devagar Bookstore - Lisbon – Portugal,  Mare Calamus - Jorge Vieira Museum - Beja – Portugal. 2001: The Hitchiker Drumbeat - The Garage Studio - North Providence – USA. 1999: Kurasson Di Sibitchi – Cultural Palace - Praia/CCM – Cultural Centre of Mindelo - Cape Verde, Serenata Em Bilingue - Teatro Baltazar Dias - Funchal – Madeira.1998: Insulano (11ª ilha) - Galeria Municipal da Amadora – Portugal, Águalusa & Terracota - Recreios da Amadora - Portugal, Lantuna Na Mei Di Mar - EXPO'98 - Lisboa – Portugal.  1997: Lágrimas de Indigo - INAC - Praia/ Cultural Centre of Mindelo - Cape Verde. 1995: Mitomorfoses - INAC - Praia/ People’s Palace - Mindelo - Cape Verde,  Duet - Galeria Gymnasium - Lisbon – Portugal. 1989: 15 Alternative Snapshots from Cape Verde – CV Association - Lisbon - Portugal.  1983: Painting & Crafts – French Cultural Centre - Praia - Cape Verde.\n\nParagraph 17: Digital humanities scholars use computational methods either to answer existing research questions or to challenge existing theoretical paradigms, generating new questions and pioneering new approaches. One goal is to systematically integrate computer technology into the activities of humanities scholars, as is done in contemporary empirical social sciences. Yet despite the significant trend in digital humanities towards networked and multimodal forms of knowledge, a substantial amount of digital humanities focuses on documents and text in ways that differentiate the field's work from digital research in media studies, information studies, communication studies, and sociology. Another goal of digital humanities is to create scholarship that transcends textual sources. This includes the integration of multimedia, metadata, and dynamic environments (see The Valley of the Shadow project at the University of Virginia, the Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular at University of Southern California, or Digital Pioneers projects at Harvard). A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets such as the Google Books corpus. Examples of such projects were highlighted by the Humanities High Performance Computing competition sponsored by the Office of Digital Humanities in 2008, and also by the Digging Into Data challenge organized in 2009 and 2011 by NEH in collaboration with NSF, and in partnership with JISC in the UK, and SSHRC in Canada. In addition to books, historical newspapers can also be analyzed with big data methods. The analysis of vast quantities of historical newspaper content has showed how periodic structures can be automatically discovered, and a similar analysis was performed on social media. As part of the big data revolution, gender bias, readability, content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents and historical documents written in literary Chinese.\n\nParagraph 18: On 8 August, the Allies launched their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, around Amiens. The 11th Battalion did not take part in the opening phase of the offensive, moving to Hamel and establishing themselves in a defensive position around Harbonnieres. On 10 August, the battalion was committed to a strong attack around Lihons; although successful, the attack lasted three days and resulted in heavy casualties, including 58 killed and 140 wounded. On the night of 12/13 August, the 11th was withdrawn to the support line just behind the front. Later, they were moved to Vaire and then Cerisy, before supporting the 9th and 12th Battalions around Chuignolles and Proyart on 23 August and then around Chuignes and Cappy two days later, where further losses were experienced.  The 11th Battalion's final attack came against the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September when they launched a three-company attack around Fervaque Farm and Carpeza Copse near Villeret. Despite being severely understrength – each company had an average strength of just 76 men – they advanced over  and took over 120 prisoners and large quantities of German equipment, for the loss of 18 men killed. Further casualties came on 24 October when German aircraft attacked the battalion headquarters, killing a number of officers, including Darnell, who was the acting commanding officer. The heavy casualties that the Australians had suffered during the final year of the war, and the decrease in volunteers arriving from Australia, meant that the battalion was desperately understrength. In October, they were withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation, at the insistence of the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes. At this time, the battalion was reorganised into a two-company structure. In early November, the battalion prepared to return to the front around St. Quentin, but before they could return to the fighting, an armistice came into effect, bringing the war to an end.\n\nParagraph 19: Back in Turkey, Azmi's wife Güzin receives one of his letters. She frets because it is the first she has heard from him in ten days. Güzin spends her time with her best friend, Sadan. Sadan's mother, who has a heart condition, says Sadan has been ill and walking in her sleep lately, though Sadan seems happy as she recently became engaged to Turan. Güzin and Sadan go to the seashore, and while taking a walk, they meet four men carrying a coffin-like box, which they say is full of dirt from Romania. The men say that two other men hired to move the boxes of earth disappeared in transit. That night Sadan walks in her sleep. Güzin follows her to the seashore and sees her near the foot of a seaside staircase, being preyed upon by Dracula, who disappears. Güzin walks Sadan back to her room. Sadan begins to suffer from a mysterious illness that leaves her pale and weak. Her illness baffles Dr. Akif, and Dr. Nuri is called to examine Sadan, noticing that she has two tiny wounds on her throat. Güzin meanwhile learns that Azmi is being nursed back to health in a hospital in Edirne. She goes to bring him home. Dr. Nuri recommends blood transfusions for Sadan, and also places garlic in her room and prepares a wreath of it for her to wear in her sleep. He warns that her windows should not be opened at night. That night, Sadan's mother removes the necklace, and The Count breaks the window to Sadan's room and attacks her. Sadan's mother, who is still in the room at the time, dies of a heart attack. Azmi and Güzin return from Edirne, but they are too late. Sadan is on her deathbed, the marks from her neck have vanished and her teeth appear longer and sharper. She speaks with strange seductiveness to Turan, but Dr. Nuri prevents Turan from kissing her. Sadan dies, is buried and then rises as a vampire, who preys on children. Dr. Nuri, Azmi, Güzin, Dr. Akif, and Turan agree to join forces against the Count. Dr. Nuri tells the others of his suspicions about Dracula, and about his limitations: he retreats from garlic, and he can be killed by a stake through the heart or by decapitation. Dr. Nuri also reveals that the wounds in the children's throats weren't made in the same way as Sadan's wounds, but were made by Sadan herself. Dr. Nuri leads Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan to the graveyard by night. Inside the tomb, Sadan's coffin is empty.\n\nParagraph 20: ,  and  have written in detail about changes in the musical life of Leipzig both during Bach's lifetime and its aftermath. The difficulties in finding students from the university available to perform as instrumentalists was already a problem while Johann Kuhnau was Thomaskantor, responsible for two main churches, the Nikolaikirche and the Thomaskirche, as well as the Neuekirche. With Bach replacing Kuhnau, arranging church performances became more orderly. Apart from secular concert music in the Café Zimmermann, there were public concerts advertised as \"Concerts Spirituels\" in the Gewandhaus and the open air. At the end of the eighteenth century, Protestant worship and liturgical music was reformed in Saxony, with hardly any use of Latin in the church. With the turn of the century Germany saw a \"Bach renewal,\" in which Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann were to play an important role. The musicians Franz Hauser and Moritz Hauptmann also became active in this movement. At one stage Hauser asked Mendelssohn whether he might wish to be successor as Thomaskantor; but, with Mendelssohn's prompting and encouragement, it was Hauptmann who assumed that post in 1842, albeit reluctantly. Aided by Hauser, whose personal collection of Bach manuscripts was one of the largest in Germany, Hauptmann, Schumann and his colleagues, Otto Jahn and Carl Becker, started the Bach-Gesellschaft in 1850; and soon after, in 1851, Hauptmann published the first volume of ten cantatas BWV 1–10 with Breitkopf & Härtel. Hauptmann and Hauser became directors of the conservatory in Leipzig and Munich respectively and the pair carried on a long correspondence, which has been documented in German and English. For cantatas, Hauptmann records that, although separate movements might be suitable for public performance, changes in nineteenth-century practices often made it hard to find suitable instrumentalists. Other musicians such as Johann Nepomuk Schelble, who had conducted a performance of BWV 8 in Frankfurt am Main, considered that eighteenth-century recitatives might no longer be suitable for the public, so could be cut. Carl von Winterfeld expressed doubts about whether Bach's larger sacred works \"could find a lasting place in a newly united, newly invigorated and strength evangelical church of our day.\"\n\nParagraph 21: Granddaughter of Brahmakesari Keshab Chandra Sen, Sadhona was born in a prosperous Brahmo family and received education as was common with Brahmo girls of those days. Her father was Saral Chandra Sen and she was the second of his three daughters. Her elder sister Benita Roy was married into a royal family of Chittagong (now in Bangladesh) and settled to household life, while the youngest Nilina pursued a career in Indian Classical music and earned herself a position of eminence and was known in record circles as Naina Devi. Sadhona married Madhu Bose, film maker working in Bengal, British India, at a young age, and joined the Calcutta Art Players, a theatrical company owned by husband Modhu Bose and took part as heroine in the plays produced by the unit. Later on Sadhona joined films and played Marjina in Alibaba (1937), made in Bengali under the banner of Bharatlakshmi Pictures. This film was a runaway hit and is remembered well by film enthusiasts. Modhu Bose had earlier directed a number of films but he tasted real success with Alibaba. For Sadhona this film meant a permanent place in the history of Bengali films. This was followed with Abhinoy (Bengali-1938), another major success for the couple. They migrated to Bombay and again created history with the immensely popular Kumkum (1940), made in two languages, hindi and Bengali and thereafter went on to create the first triple version (English, Bengali, Hindi) film of India, Rajnartaki (1941). Sadhona did come back to Calcutta for a double version Bengali movie Meenakshi (1942)with the handsome Jyoti Prakash as the hero. Going back to Bombay soon after the completion of this film where she starred in major films like Shankar Parvati, Vishkanya, Paigham and others and firmly established herself as a heroine in her own right without the backing of her husband..In fact they had separated but she came back to calcutta after a reconciliation with Modhu  and acted in films again directed by her husband like Shesher Kabita and Maa O Chhele, with some limited success. Sadhona was a excellent dancer and almost all her film successes were in dancing roles. She was also a very fine actress and singer, too. She sang her own songs in some of her films including her first Alibaba. With film offers becoming too infrequent, she formed a dance troupe of her own and made all India tours with plays like Wither now, Hunger and others and met with success again. Even  Just before her death she got appointed as dance trainer in Calcutta's prestigious Star Theatre, courtesy her one time friend Timir Baran. She trained junior artistes for the play Janapad Badhu and once again her name featured in the newspapers in the advertisements of the play. However, she died in September 1973.\n\nParagraph 22: As the debate raged, Shastriji Maharaj paid it no heed, but continued to preach in the villages and propagate the Akshar-Purushottam doctrine. Soon, he began to plan and construct a temple in which Akshar-Purushottam Maharaj would be installed in the central shrine. On 5 June 1907, Shastri Yagnapurushdas consecrated the murtis of Swaminarayan and Gunatitanand Swami in the newly constructed mandir in the village of Bochasan. This marked the beginning of BAPS as an organization since it was the first mandir to have both murtis of Akshar and Purushottam in the central shrine. Shastriji Maharaj continued to propagate the Akshar-Purushottam doctrine and build mandirs, while the coterie of his detractors in the Vadtal diocese continued to attempt to validate his excommunication. Years after the event, they attempted to pressure Gordhanbhai Kothari, then 90 years old and blind, to sign the order of excommunication, but he bluntly refused. Finally, in 1935, an incident in Swaminarayan mandir in the village of Ishnav led to a lawsuit against Shastriji Maharaj by the Acharya of Vadtal that brought the dispute of Shastriji Maharaj's standing in the Vadtal diocese to its \"legal conclusion.\" A group of Shastriji Maharaj’s swamis had visited the village of Ishnav and stayed at the local mandir \"with the approval of some villagers but against the wishes of the trustee\" Consequently, the Acharya of Vadtal filed a lawsuit aiming to prohibit swamis of the Akshar-Purushottam Sanstha from using properties belonging to the Vadtal diocese on the grounds that they had been officially excommunicated. Although a local judge upheld the legality of Shastri Yagnapurushdas’ expulsion, the verdict was appealed and the District judge, Mr. J.D Kapadiya ruled in favor of Shastri Yagnapurushdas when he stated, \"The laws of natural justice have clearly been broken in these proceedings [of 1906], and I have no hesitation in holding that as far as the law courts are concerned they would not recognize the excommunication of defendant No. 1 [Yagnapurushdas].\" Thus, Judge Kapadiya overturned the ruling of the lower court and validated that Shastri Yagnapurushdas had not been legally excommunicated from the Vadtal diocese. However, he cited an affidavit from Shastri Yagnapurushdas to rule that he had succeeded from the Vadtal diocese, and was now the head of an organization independent of \"the holders of the Vadatal[sic] or Ahmedabad Gadi. Ultimately, the judge ruled that BAPS swamis did not have the right to stay or preach in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya and he restrained Shastri Yagnapurushdas from sending his swamis to that temple.\"\n\nParagraph 23: In 253, Zhuge Ke, the regent of Wei's rival state Eastern Wu, led Wu forces to attack Xincheng and surrounded the fortress. Zhang Te, along with Yue Fang () and others, led 3,000 troops to defend Xincheng. During this time, he sent his subordinates Liu Zheng () and Zheng Xiang () to break out of the siege and seek reinforcements, but Zhuge Ke's men intercepted and captured them. In desperation, Zhang Te lied to the enemy: \"I've no intention of fighting now. However, according to the laws of Wei, when I'm under attack for more than 100 days and reinforcements do not arrive, even if I surrender, my family will be spared from punishment. Since I first started resisting the enemy, it has been more than 90 days. This city originally had a population of more than 4,000, and now more than half of them have died in battle. Even when the city falls, if someone does not wish to surrender, I'll speak to him and explain the possible implications of his choice. Tomorrow morning I'll send a list of names, you can first take my tally as a token of trust.\" Although Zhuge Ke did not accept Zhang Te's tally, he believed that Zhang Te wanted to surrender so he ordered his troops to stop attacking. Zhang Te and his remaining troops then seized the opportunity to make repairs to the walls and strengthen their defences overnight. The following morning, Zhang Te told the enemy: \"We shall fight to the death!\" Zhuge Ke turned furious when he realised he had been fooled, so he ordered his troops to mount a fierce assault on the fortress. However, his troops were already exhausted and weary after several days of siege, and they failed to breach Xincheng's walls. When Zhuge Ke sensed that his army's morale was falling, he had no choice but to withdraw back to Wu.\n\nParagraph 24: Started from 7 February 2016 with a win over Vitória, Sporting went on a 32 match unbeaten streak as of the 19th round of the 2016–17 season, of any island leagues, it is behind CS Mindelense with 34 matches which occurred between 2014 and 2016. Also Sporting had a 22 match unbeaten streak away at the regionals and surpassed that of São Vicente's, Mindelense's 18 match unbeaten streak at home and five more away which lasted from 2014 to April 2016. Overall, it is behind Académica Porto Novo's record of 30 which was from 2012 to April 2016.  Sporting got 49 points, a club record tied with previous seasons with that total in 2005, Sporting achieved a large chance of becoming regional championship at the 20th round and became after their victory over Desportivo 0–1 on 7 April and also another seven match winning streak of the season was made.  Sporting got the South Zone's ninth regional title. Also Sporting's points total which is the region's highest became 52, a new record made succeeding their 49 which they had in 2005.  Sporting's attempt of making further club record in points completely vanished after their only loss to Boavista at the 23rd round, another mighty club of the city.  Sporting's final match of the season was a victory over Tchadense and Sporting made 55 points, a club record that Sporting cherished.  Of any of the island leagues in the nation, third it became behind Scorpion Vermelho's 61 of the north of the island.  17 wins Sporting got, a new club record superseded their 2005 totals and 43 goals scored, less than the previous season.  In the 2017 regional cup, originally for 19 May, it was set for 7 May, Sporting defeated Garridos and won their recent cup title after winning 5–3 in the penalty shootout as the match ended in a goal draw.  The regional Super Cup took place on 28 October and featured, Sporting defeated the cup runner-up Garridos and won their third and recent super cup title for the south of the island.\n\nParagraph 25: Oberstaufenbach can be considered a clump village with loosely scattered houses. The original settlement grew on the Reichenbach's left bank and on both sides of the Limbach. Only with the building of the road in the Reichenbach valley did residential development arise here, along the road, both towards Reichenbach and towards Niederstaufenbach. Also built were houses along former farm lanes. Over the last two decades, the slopes near the village have also been opened to extensive building development. Worthy of note is an armorial stone found on the gable at the family Grill's house. It came about 1871/1872 as a keystone from a gateway arch to Oberstaufenbach. In Weilerbach, the house's builder had acquired bits of the former Schellenberger Hof, among other things the stones from the gateway arch, when that estate was torn down. He brought them to Oberstaufenbach, thinking to use them in his own building work. He set the keystone, which bears the von Horn coat of arms, in the walling in his house's gable. As early as 1855, the municipality of Oberstaufenbach laid out its own graveyard on the way out of the village going towards Neunkirchen am Potzberg, and not many years ago, it also had a mortuary built there. The former Heidenburg (literally “ castle”) is described in literature time and again as a Römerkastell (“Roman fort”). Only in the 1994 publication Oberstaufenbach im Wandel der Zeit (“Oberstaufenbach Through the Ages”) can a systematic reappraisal of this storied knoll be found. The writer came to the following conclusion: The knoll was fortified from early to middle La Tène times. In Roman times, nothing more than grave monuments and godstones were set up there. Reports of archaeological finds during the 19th century mention almost nothing but carved images, and conspicuous by their almost utter absence are reports of any finds of coins. Thus, any notion that a Roman fort once stood upon the knoll must be thoroughly revised. In the 10th century, there may well have been a wooden chapel standing there, and it seems likely that in the centuries that followed, this would have been replaced with a stone building. At the same time, work on a tower castle began. No later than the 12th century, this castle was provided with a girding wall and a well shaft. Nevertheless, the castle was forsaken before the Middle Ages had even ended, and hence, a written mention of it is nowhere to be found. In the 19th century, the knoll became the location for something else, a hard-stone quarry. The work there removed any remnant of the old castle that had lain there for centuries. Also unearthed at the site were pieces of Roman grave monuments, which might themselves have been used later to build the castle. In bygone centuries, the municipal area was a tangle of crisscrossing property lines, with often very small fields. In 1976, however, Flurbereinigung was undertaken, forming contiguous blocks of farmland, some quite big.\n\nParagraph 26: The Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose Project is a potential mega multipurpose storage project on the Karnali River at Chisapani, envisaging a  high dam, with reservoir area of , with power station operating under a design head of  to operate 18 units of 620 MW capacity each ( 10,800 MW installed capacity) and with a re-regulating weir downstream with power plant of 84 MW capacity operating under a head of . A large-scale irrigation development is also envisaged— in Nepal and  in India. Project planning commenced in 1960, although the feasibility study for the project was only completed in 1989. Before this project is developed a number of significant underlying issues have to be resolved. These issues include: Nepal and India reaching a bilateral agreement on the downstream benefits of regulated river flows; the resettlement of over 60,000 people; the impact on and restoration of habitat within Bardia National Park; and, above all, the financial arrangements for project funding. Accordingly, it is predicted that the chances of this project being implemented before 2025 are very slim, although increasing international pressure on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy generation sector may assist project initiation. While the likelihood of this project being developed by 2025 is low, Nepal and India could cooperate to develop this project to meet India's growing energy demand from renewable resources.\n\nParagraph 27: This destructive tornado touched down on the southwest side of Petersburg, and rapidly intensified as it struck the historic downtown area of the city. Several well-built, multi-story brick buildings were leveled, along with a train station. A decorative caboose near the train station was ripped from its anchors and thrown 20 feet, pulling the anchors out of the ground in the process. Damage in downtown Petersburg was rated as F4. The tornado then moved through the Pocahontas Island neighborhood at F3 intensity, heavily damaging or destroying 47 homes and a church. A total of 100 buildings were damaged or destroyed in Petersburg. The tornado then crossed into Colonial Heights, severely damaging a strip mall, a K-mart, and a waterbed store. A Wal-Mart was destroyed, with three fatalities occurring at that location. Many cars in the parking lot were tossed and destroyed as well. Damage in Colonial Heights was rated as low-end F3. The tornado then crossed into Prince George County at F2 intensity, striking a sand and gravel company. Several cars and trucks were overturned, the second floor of a cinder-block building was destroyed, conveyor belts were twisted and overturned, and one person was killed at that location. Many trees were downed throughout the county. The tornado then struck the north side of Hopewell at F1 intensity, where it blew roofs off of an apartment complex. The tornado caused minor damage to an additional 49 homes, major damage to 13 homes and destroyed two other homes in Hopewell. The tornado exited Hopewell, weakened to an F0, and dissipated in Charles City County. From start to finish, this storm caused 4 deaths and 246 injuries. It was the deadliest Virginia tornado since 10 people were killed in Ivy on September 30, 1959. It was also the first recorded F4 tornado in Virginia state history. For a number of years afterwards, the remains of a damage swath (sheared, twisted and broken vegetation) through thick trees was visible along the west side of I-95 on the immediate north side of the Appomattox crossing. Perhaps one of the longest lasting reminders of the twister was on the Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge between Colonial Heights and Petersburg. As the tornado had smashed through the historic district, it ripped a traffic light off the bridge, and the snapped pillars remained until the bridge was replaced in 2002. As a result of the damage that occurred, a State of emergency was issued for Petersburg.\n\nParagraph 28: A man called Nana Takyi Fri went out hunting daily to feed himself and his younger sisters after they had settled in a forest. His youngest sister, Afia Ankomah decided to go fishing in the forest, preferring fish to the meat of an animal. When she got to the water banks, she put her fishing basket into the water to catch fish, but when she though that she had caught a fish, she saw that something else had ended up in the basket. Not thinking much of it, she took it out of the basket. But all of a sudden, the place became dark. Every time she put it back into the basket the darkness would go, and every time she took it out of the basket, the darkness would return. As a result, she knew that she'd have to take it home as if she didn't, the place would become dark and she wouldn't be able to retrace her steps home. So she took it home, but asa soon as she reached home, she was possessed by the object. The object, through Afia identified himself to her siblings as the river deity Asuo Tano, for which he was to live with them. He brought Nana Takyi Fri and his family to the place where he dwelled, protected by a horde of baboons. He taught Nana Takyi Fri and his family his laws and rules so they could live with him and his family. Nana Takyi Fri became the hunter for the family, whilst Afia Ankomah (the youngest sister) became the first Priestess for Ta Kora. In time she married Amadu, a Dagomban blacksmith, whose first wife was called Amea Tomfour who came from Sheawu Besease. Nana Takyi Fri pleaded with Amadu to marry his little Priestess sister for the reason to relieve her of her spiritual workload through her nephews and nieces, as Takyi was not interested in helping his sister with her spiritual work. Amadu agreed and he and Afi got married and have a son, whom they called Nana Fosu Aduanwoma. When he came of age, his mother Afia retired all of her spiritual duties to him and he inherited the shrine elements of the Great Tano. After this, Takyi decided to move forward for his plan to find a new settlement. He moved to Tuabodom with Amoafowaa (his sister), leaving his little sister behind. The Great Tano decided to send one of his children called Twumpuro to possess Takyi Ofri. Takyi Fri and Amoafowaa left Takyi Ofri behind after their Priestess sister to help her and her son with their spiritual duties. It was clear that Takyi Fri was trying to avoid his spiritual assignments, something that the Great Tano would not allow. So when Takyi Fri moved to a new settlement in present-day Tachiman, the Great Tano again sent his son Taamensah (Tano Mensah) to possess Takyi Fri's sister Amoafowaa. Takyi Fri finally realised that he couldn't keep running from his spiritual obligations, so he accepted his spiritual obligations and stayed at his settlement, in the process founding the Techiman nation, which means the nation of Takyi.\n\nParagraph 29: On 5 December 2001, Home from Home was announced for released in early 2002. Six days later, the album's track listing was revealed. \"Man or Mouse\" was posted on the band's website on 4 January 2002. \"Kemp\" was released as a single on 23 January 2001. On 2 February 2001, \"Fingers Crossed\" was made available for download after playing a game on the band's website. In February and March 2002, the band toured across Australia and New Zealand. On 7 March 2002, the music video for \"Kemp\" was posted online; it was animated by Kalle Haglund, the former vocalist of Voice of a Generation. Home from Home was released on 11 March 2002 in Europe through Burning Heart, and the following day in the US through Epitaph. While on tour in the US, drummer Fredrik Larzon injured his elbow, which required him to fly back to Sweden for surgery; he was temporarily replaced by Thomas Falk of Bombshell Rocks.\n\nParagraph 30: Paeonia daurica was first described by Henry Cranke Andrews in the seventh volume of his Botanist's Repository published in 1807. A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P. wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P. wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P. corallina and P. corallina var. triternata, and P. wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P. triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P. corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P. wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow was the first to think that a difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P. wittmanniana to P. corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P. corallina, P. mlokosewitschii, P. macrophylla, P. wittmanniana, and introduced P. wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P. triternata and P. corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P. corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P. wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P. mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P. corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P. mlokosewitschii, P. wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P. tomentosa and the new P. abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P. mlokosewitschii – as part of the series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets – and P. triternata, P. caucasica, P. wittmanniana, P. macrophylla, P. tomentosa and P. abchasica – all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P. daurica, P. mlokosewitschii and P. wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P. kavachensis (= P. caucasica), P. mlokosewitschii (including P. tomentosa) and P. wittmanniana (including P. abchasica). P. wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P. steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P. abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P. ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text is about a woman named Güzin who receives a letter from her husband, Azmi, after not hearing from him for ten days. Güzin spends time with her friend Sadan, who recently got engaged to Turan. Sadan's health begins to deteriorate, and she starts sleepwalking. One night, Güzin follows Sadan and witnesses her being attacked by Dracula near the seashore. Sadan falls ill, and doctors try to figure out her mysterious illness. Güzin learns that Azmi is in the hospital, so she goes to bring him home. Dr. Nuri suggests blood transfusions and putting garlic in Sadan's room to protect her. However, Sadan's mother removes the garlic necklace, and Dracula attacks Sadan, causing her mother to die of a heart attack. Azmi and Güzin return too late, and Sadan dies, only to rise as a vampire. The group joins forces to fight against Dracula, and Dr. Nuri reveals his suspicions about the vampire. They go to the graveyard and find that Sadan's coffin is empty.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

On October 23, 1998, Olímpico headlined his first CMLL show, losing the CMLL Welterweight title to Halcón Negro. A week later Olímpico once again faced Halcón Negro in the main event, this time defeating Negro in a Luchas de Apuesta, winning the mask of his opponent. On February 27, 1999, Olímpico made his first trip to Japan, losing the CMLL Welterweight title to Super Delfin. Back in Mexico Olímpico worked a feud against Rey Bucanero, a feud that involved mask ripping every time the two were in the same ring, building to a Luchas de Apuesta between the two. The match never happened however; instead Rey Bucanero lost his mask to Shocker leaving the Olímpico / Bucanero storyline unfinished. On March 30, 2000, Olímpico, Mr. Niebla, and Safari defeated the team of Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera, and El Signo to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. In 2002, CMLL decided to create a Mini-Estrella version of Olímpico called Pequeño Olímpico, a short wrestler who wore an outfit patterned after Olímpico's outfit at the time. On June 23, 2003, Olímpico, Mr. Niebla, and Safari lost the Trios title to Los Nuevo Infernales, the team of Averno, Mephisto, and Satánico. After working as a tecnico (a good guy character, called a face in wrestling) since 1992, Olímpico turned rudo (villain or Heel) on February 20, 2004 as he turned on his tag team partners El Felino and Virus during a match, allowing the team of Zumbido, Violencia and Veneno to win the match. Following his turn he joined a group called Los Guerreros del Infierno with Último Guerrero, Rey Bucanero, and Tarzan Boy. While his rudo turn was surprising, it was soon overshadowed when Atlantis turned rudo and joined Los Guerreros in early 2005, relegating Olímpico to the secondary trios teams, working with Tarzan Boy and other Los Guerrero's associates while the team Último Guerrero, Rey Bucanero, and Atlantis was the main Guerreros del Infierno team. On September 30, 2005, Olímpico and Atlantis were chosen to challenge Hiroshi Tanahashi and Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, when the Japanese duo made a trip to Mexico; Tanahashi and Nakamura successfully defended the title. Over the next three years Olímpico worked the semi-main and sometimes main event Trios matches but never got the \"big\" match or won any championships.\n\nParagraph 2: Stigma's official debut date was given as July 26, 2010, but as he is a masked wrestler it is possible that he worked as a different ring character before that date. Stigma trained at the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) wrestling school in Puebla, Puebla and worked primarily in Arena Puebla early on. Initially he made a large number of mistakes during his matches, due to nerves and inexperience, but the mistakes coupled with the fact that the Arena Puebla bookers quickly promoted him up the ranks made the fans critical of him and often booed him during his early career. Stigma stepped back, intensified his training and by 2012 he had become a more skilled, well rounded wrestler who was earning his position in CMLL through his skills. He was one of 16 young wrestlers who participated in the first ever Torneo Sangre Nueva (\"Young Blood Tournament\"), designed specifically to elevate some of these young wrestlers up the ranks. Stigma took part in the Block A torneo cibernetico elimination match. Stigma lost to Cancerbero in a match won by Dragon Lee. In the months following the Sangre Nueva tournament Stigma became involved in a \"Puebla vs. Los Coliseinos\" (wrestlers who came from Arena Coliseo in Mexico City), defending his home town of Puebla against the \"Outsiders\". The feud led to a 12-man torneo cibernetico where \"Team Puebla\" (Stigma, Asturiano, Espiritu Maligno, Karissma, Lestat and Milenium) defeated \"Team Coliseinos\" (Dragon Lee, Hombre Bala Jr., Pegasso, Puma King, Skándalo and Súper Comando). The following week all 12 competitors risked either their mask or hair as they participated in a Lucha de Apuesta (\"Bet match\") Steel cage match. Stigma escaped the cage, keeping his mask safe while Puma King defeated Karissma to unmask him. Stigma made his Super Viernes debut on the October 5, 2012 version, teaming with Camaleón to defeat Los Hombres del Camoflaje (Artillero and Súper Comando). Working on CMLL's main show was a sign that CMLL had plans to promote Stigma on a national level instead of only locally in Puebla. Stigma participated in the 2013 Torneo Sangre Nueva, but like in 2012 did not make it past the preliminary round as he was eliminated by Bobby Zavala. In late March, 2013 Stigma was announced as one of the Novatos, or rookies, in the 2013 Torneo Gran Alternativa, or \"Great Alternative tournament\". The Gran Alternativa pairs a rookie with an experienced wrestler for a tag team tournament. Stigma teamed with veteran La Mascara. The two competed in Block A on April 12, 2013 losing to Taurus and Averno in the first round. Alt URL Stigma defeated Espiritu Maligno for his first Mask vs Mask in July 29, 2013 in Arena Puebla. Stigma defeated Camorra for his Mask vs Mask in December 30, 2013 in Arena Puebla. In Arena Puebla, on July 16, 2014 Stigma unsuccessfully challenged Virus for the CMLL World Lightweight Championship. In January 2015, Stigma made his New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) debut, when he worked the Fantastica Mania 2015 tour, co-produced by CMLL and NJPW. In May, 2015 CMLL Stigma competed in a qualifying match for the 2015 version of En Busca de un Ídolo as one of 16 wrestlers in the qualifying torneo cibernetico, elimination match where the last eight wrestlers would qualify for the tournament. He competed against Akuma, Blue Panther Jr., Cancerbero, Canelo Casas, Delta, Disturbio, Esfinge, Flyer, El Gallo, Guerrero Maya Jr., Joker, Pegasso, Raziel, Sagrado and Boby Zavala. Stigma pinned Pegasso during the match but ended up being the seventh wrestler eliminated, pinned by Esfinge.\n\nParagraph 3: Jerry Lawler was going to join the broadcast team in 2012 on SmackDown until he had a heart attack. Lawler became ill with diverticulitis on January 1, 2015, leading to the WWE pay-per-view events kickoff analyst Booker T taking his announcing duties. When Lawler recovered from diverticulitis, WWE moved him to the SmackDown broadcasting team after the broadcast on January 9, 2015, with his first air date as January 15, 2015. Booker T also joined the broadcast team on Raw as the alternate color commentator on September 26, 2011, until October 3, 2011, and October 2, 2011, at Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, along with Michael Cole and Jim Ross, April 25, 2011 Raw episode alongside Josh Mathews, Cole and Lawler, and he also joined with Cole and Lawler to provide commentary on June 20, 2011, November 21, 2011, and March 26, 2012. On June 1, 2015, Booker T left Raw as a commentator to film Tough Enough, leaving the color-commentator position vacant. However, NXT color commentator and WWE pay-per-view events kickoff analyst Byron Saxton replaced him afterwards on June 8, 2015. Saxton appeared as guest announcer on Raw for two weeks after WrestleMania 31, alongside Jerry Lawler because Cole, Layfield, and Booker T were assaulted by Brock Lesnar in the opening segment. Cole, Lawler, and Layfield would continue to provide commentary during WWE pay-per-view events until December 13, 2015 (TLC), before Saxton took over for Lawler at the announce table on the next pay-per-view events (Royal Rumble, Fastlane and others) in 2016. For the 52 episodes of Raw in 2014, it was noted that only 18 episodes (34.6%) featured the show ending with a main event match with a decisive finish. At one point around WrestleMania, there were 10 occasions over 11 weeks where Raw ended with either a talking segment or a main event that ended in a disqualification or non-finish.Raw was awarded the 2014 Wrestling Observer Newsletter award for Worst Television Show, while its commentators John Layfield, Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole came in the top three in that order for the Worst Television Announcer award. Jon Mezzera and Wade Keller of Pro Wrestling Torch said respectively in 2015 that the Raw commentators \"don't pay attention to the product. They are too busy making jokes and talking about other segments on the show and bickering with each other to actually pay attention and call what is happening in a match\" and \"It's not the announcers, though, it's the direction they're given. That falls on Vince McMahon\".\n\nParagraph 4: Bertha Mae and Haldor Lillenas were partners in ministry. The partnership began at the beginning, when they were ordained together in 1912 as elders in the Church of the Nazarene by Dr. H. F. Reynolds at the 1912 assembly of the Southern California District. Their first ministry together had already begun in 1910 at the Peniel Mission in Sacramento, California. In the early days of their work, they were often in itinerant ministries and were poor. They sometimes relied on donations received while conducting street ministry. The couple received their first co-pastorate in 1910 for a church in Lompoc, California. Without the constant need to travel for itinerant ministry, the couple were able to start a family at this time. The couple had two children—Evangeline Mae (1911) and Wendell Haldor (1915). Together the couple led churches in Lompoc, California (1910-1912), Pomona, California (1912-1914), Auburn, Illinois (1916-1919), Peniel, Texas (1919-1920), Redlands, California (1920-1923), and Indianapolis, Indiana (1923-1926). Although both were accomplished hymnists, Haldor focused more so on the music ministry and was often away from their congregations for as much as three weeks at a time to work as a music evangelist. During the times that he was away, the pastoral leadership of the churches was left to Bertha Mae. While Haldor focused on hymn writing and publishing, Bertha Mae's success as a church planter and leader grew. Her most successful pastorate, at Indianapolis First Church of the Nazarene, saw the congregation double in size in just three years. While Bertha Mae took a primary role in the preaching in Indianapolis, Haldor was able to launch a publishing company, Lillenas Publishing, in 1924. At roughly the same time, however, Bertha Mae's health began to decline. The couple resigned from the co-pastorate in 1926. In 1930, Haldor sold the publishing company to The Nazarene Publishing House in Kansas City, Missouri and the couple moved to Missouri. In Missouri, Haldor continued to manage the business of Lillenas Publishing, while Bertha Mae devoted her time to missions and revivals. Bertha Mae became the second vice president of the Women's General Missionary Council of the Nazarene Church in 1930. In this role, she advocated for youth missions and edited the newsletter, Junior Light Bearers. As Bertha Mae's health continued to decline, the couple purchased and moved, in 1940, to a stone house near the Lake of the Ozarks that they named Melody Lane. Bertha Mae died five years later on April 13, 1945. She was buried at Forest Hill Calvary Cemetery in Kansas City.\n\nParagraph 5: The house's design was first conceived in 1885 by the architecture firm of Frank Bailey and Farmer. George William Frank, youngest son of George Washington Frank, was in charge of the firm. He designed the house as a gift to his parents. Construction on the house began in 1886 and was completed in 1889. George Washington Frank and his wife Phoebe moved into the home in 1890, possibly waiting for the large stained glass window on the second floor landing to be installed. The main floor of the home includes a Library, Grand Reception Hall, Front Vestibule, Drawing Room, Kitchen, Range Room, Butler's Pantry, Dining Room, two bathrooms, and George and Phoebe's private quarters. Each of these rooms, except the Kitchen, Range Room, and Butler's Pantry, were complete with their own hand carved fireplaces with imported tile from both the Netherlands and New Jersey. The house was the first west of the Missouri River to be wired for electricity during construction. Frank would entertain numerous investors at the house, hoping to draw attention to his businesses and success in Kearney. To draw attention to his success in the generation of hydroelectric power, and his installation of electric streetcars in Kearney, all the light fixtures in the home were based around the incandescent electric light bulb. The light fixtures featured little intricate detail, and even the original dining room fixture was four light bulbs at the end of a wire. While entertaining, the Franks would hire a famous opera singer to sing as the guests were arriving at the house. A harpist would play in the dining room during all of their meals, and an electric buzzer was located under the dining room table to summon servants when the next course for meals needed to be brought to the table. The Library of the house was rarely, if ever, used as a library. George Frank would bring many investors and guests to the room to show them out the window. The large window in the library looked east across the grounds of the house, and one could see Frank's power plant and the skyline of Kearney before the subsequent planting of trees and establishment of the Kearney State Normal School to the east of the house in 1905. Frank used the Drawing Room as his private office and kept a large oak desk in the center of the room, which was eventually taken down to the local pharmacy to pay for medication for Phoebe. The Drawing Room also housed the largest fireplace mantle out of the ten fireplaces located in the home. George and Phoebe's private quarters were also located on the main floor. Private chambers on the main floor of a home were often considered a scandal in the late 1800s, but George and Phoebe were in their late 60's when they moved in and did not want to bother with the stairs. The second floor included numerous guest rooms and a bedroom for the Franks' head cook and chief of staff, Eliza Galloway. Eliza was a freed African American slave from Maryland and had met George Washington Frank's brother Augustus in New York. When Frank lost the house in 1900 he gave his silver and china collections to her to start her own catering company. The third floor was used as servants' quarters, and at its peak would have held an estimated 47 staff members. The basement of the home was originally furnished and was home to a wine cellar, billiards room, and the bedroom of the Franks' coachman, John Dallas Sauders. By 1900, grieving the loss of his wife, and facing financial difficulty brought on by over-extension and the Panic of 1893, Frank was forced to leave the home to the bank.\n\nParagraph 6: He was sent to Dunkirk to the Romanist refugees from the Commonwealth of England, and in the midst of his missionary occupations published several books. In 1665 or 1666 he returned to Paris, and published in 1671 Les Entretiens d'Ariste et d'Eugène, which was reprinted four more times at Paris, twice at Grenoble, and afterwards at Lyon, Brussels, Amsterdam, Leiden and other cities. The work consists of six conversations (entretiens) between two companionable friends whose Greek- and Latin-derived names both mean \"well-born\", in the agreeable discursive manner of the well-informed amateur as it had become established in the salons—\"the free and familiar conversations that well-bred people have (honnêtes gens, a by-word of the précieuses of the salons) when they are friends, and which do not fail to be witty, and even knowledgeable, though one never dreams there of making wit show, and study has no part in it.\" The subjects, erudite but devoid of pedantry,  are the Sea, considered as an object of contemplation, the French language, Secrets, True Wit (\"Le Bel Esprit\"), The Ineffable (\"Le Je ne sais quoi\") and Mottoes (\"Devises\"), all expressed in flawless idiom and effortless allusions to the Classics or Torquato Tasso. The popularity of Bouhours' discursive, heuristic Entretiens extended to Poland, where Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski imitated them in Dialogues of Artakses and Ewander.\n\nParagraph 7: The Westerner is a 1940 American Western film directed by William Wyler and starring Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan and Doris Davenport. Written by Niven Busch, Stuart N. Lake and Jo Swerling, the film concerns a self-appointed hanging judge in Vinegaroon, Texas, who befriends a saddle tramp who opposes the judge's policy against homesteaders. The film is remembered for Walter Brennan's performance as Judge Roy Bean, for which he won his record-setting third Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. James Basevi and Stuart N. Lake also received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Black and White and Best Story, respectively. The supporting cast features Dana Andrews, Chill Wills and Forrest Tucker.\n\nParagraph 8: The Xanthomonadales are early divergents of bacteria within the Gammaproteobacteria, and are often used to root phylogenetic trees created for the class. Until recently, the Xanthomonodales order was inclusive of the families Xanthomonadaceae, Algiphilaceae, Solimonadaceae, Nevskiaceae and Sinobacteraceae. However, no molecular signatures were found that were inclusive of all families. The organisms were taxonomically rearranged such that Xanthomonadales included Xanthomonadaceae, which was later divided into two families. The division was in accordance with CSIs that were found specifically for all members of the emended Xanthomonadales order, providing support for the currently accepted taxonomy. All other species were transferred to Nevskiales, which did not share CSIs with Xanthomonadales, but remain close relatives within the Gammaproteobacteria. Cardiobacteriales, Chromatiales, Methylococcales, Legionellales and Thiotrichales are also deep branching orders that are phylogenetic neighbours of Xanthomonadales and Nevskiales members. The order Nevskiales harbors a single family (Salinisphaeraceae) and six  genera: Alkanibacter, Fontimonas, Hydrocarboniphaga, Nevskia, Solimonas and Steroidobacter.\n\nParagraph 9: The proposed Convention on the Rights of Older Persons (UNCROP) is likely to be the next major human rights treaty adopted by the United Nations. The proposed treaty will seek to remedy the fragmented human rights structure for Older Persons, and will focus on reaffirming critical human rights which are of concern to older persons. The focus of the treaty will be persons over 60 years of age, which is a growing demographic worldwide due to increased population ageing. The treaty follows from the success of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which has seen near universal acceptance since 1989. Where the UNCRC focuses on the rights of younger persons, the UNCROP will address those who form the older portion of society, who according to United Nations reports, are becoming increasingly vulnerable as a group without applicable normative standards of human rights law. Support for a Convention is becoming increasingly popular, as human rights groups including the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), HelpAge International, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the International Labour Organization, and many other NGOs and states have expressed support for a universal instrument. A raising number of NGOs from across the world have joined forces in advocating for a Convention in the Global Alliance for the Rights of Older Persons (GAROP) which has been set up out of the need to strengthen the rights of older persons worldwide. With population ageing, the human rights of the growing number of older persons have become an increasingly important issue. Among the human rights issues faced by older persons are ageist attitudes leading to discrimination, exclusion and constraints on the legal capacity, autonomy and independent living of older people. Existing human rights violations have been further exacerbated and put on the spotlight by the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people have been denied access to health services and became prone to physical and social isolation. The stigmatisation of older people and ageist images of older persons have also become more evident. The debate surrounding the convention focuses on the implementation and safeguarding of older persons’ human rights aiming to set normative standards of human rights for older persons in an international legally binding instrument. An underlying common factor and root cause of many of human rights violations experienced by older persons, along with its ubiquitous, prevalent, and surreptitious nature, is ageism. Ageism, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to the stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination towards others or oneself based on age. A UNCROP would go a long way to tackle ageism. Individual relationships generally fall outside of current human rights law, which seeks to present standards of relations between states and individuals. Therefore, it has been suggested that the proposed human rights convention for older persons ought to be drafted as an anti-discrimination convention. However, this would not be consistent with other multilateral human rights conventions such as the ICCPR and ICESCR which set normative standards.\n\nParagraph 10: Mills made his debut for Reading debut, starting the whole game, in a 5–1 win against Burton Albion in the first round of the League Cup. In a follow–up, he made his league debut for the club, starting the whole game, and keeping a clean sheet, in a 0–0 draw against Swansea City on 18 August 2009. Four days later on 22 August 2009, Mills scored his first goal for Reading, in a 3–1 loss against Sheffield United. However, Mills found his first team opportunities limited and was placed on the substitute bench, and for tactical reasons, according to Managers Rodgers. He also found his own injury concern along the way. Nevertheless, Mills' second goal came on 17 October 2009, in a 3–1 loss against West Brom. By January, he soon regained his first team place, dispatching a place from Alex Pearce and Darren O'Dea. Mills' performance was then praised after showing impressive display after helping the club beat Liverpool in the third round replay of the FA Cup on 13 January 2010. However against his former club, Doncaster Rovers on 7 February 2010, he was sent–off in the 80th minute for handball, resulting a penalty to the opposition team, as Reading won 2–1. After serving a one match suspension, Mills returned to the starting line–up against Crystal Palace on 17 February 2010, where he captained the club in the absence of Ívar Ingimarsson, as they won 3–1. Mills captained in a follow–up match against Blackpool, as Reading lost 2–0. After Reading's 1–0 win in March 2010 against Queens Park Rangers, Mills was seen making an apparent obscene gesture to his own supporters, for which he apologised. Manager Brian McDermott attributed his gesturing to passion, saying that Mills' actions would not dampen the player's relationship with his supporters—describing Mills' form as \"inspirational\". However, he was sent–off for the second time this season, coming against Ipswich Town on 3 April 2010 after a two footed challenge in the 30th minute, as the club lost 2–1. After serving a four match ban, Mills returned to the starting line–up and resumed his captaincy against Watford, as Reading lost 4–0 on 24 April 2010. In the absence of Ingimarsson, he captained the club in the remaining matches of the season. Mills appeared in 30 matches and scored two goals in all competitions for Reading during the 2009–10 season.\n\nParagraph 11: The manuscript is one of the most precious purple codices that survive from the Late Antique period.  It has been subjected to a non-invasive diagnostic campaign to evaluate the quality of the colourants used in its decoration, to understand how the parchment was coloured. Analyses highlighted the presence of Ultramarine Blue, which, besides the use of pure gold for the ink and paint, certifies the high value of the manuscript. In addition, this must be seen as one of the earliest examples of its use in paintings. The purple colour of the parchment was identified as Orchil, a dye extracted from lichens, similar to the results of analytical investigations carried out on other purple codices, and not the expected Tyrian purple dye.  \n\nParagraph 12: E18 was dispatched to the Baltic as part of the British submarine flotilla in the Baltic. She left Harwich on 28 August with her sister-ship HMS E19, first travelling to Newcastle to swing their compasses during which E19 burnt out one of her main armatures. After the delay to repair E19 they left Newcastle for the Baltic on 4 September at 1630 hrs. The two submarines separated and passed through the Øresund between Denmark and Sweden on the night of 8–9 September. During the passage E19 at one stage found herself only metres from E18'''s stern and decided not to enter together.  E18 encountered two German destroyers. She dived into water only  deep and — for almost three hours — progressed by crashing into the seabed and rising back up to break the surface. After several hours resting in deep water she surfaced in the morning only to be fired on by the German cruiser ; once again she dived to the bottom. The German cruiser and attending destroyers then began to criss-cross over E18 knowing her batteries would be very low. E18 had to remain on the bottom until the German ships, not then equipped with depth charges, left the area. After escaping she was attacked by another two destroyers, one of which came close to ramming her. On 10 September 1915 Halahan sighted what he thought were the German battlecruisers Lutzow and Seydlitz, and tried in vain to get into an attacking position, but in fact the ships were two German destroyers, the battlecruisers not in the area at the time. On 12 September E18 joined E19 and E9 off Dagerort, arriving in Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia) on the 13th. Halahan later wrote that entering the Baltic again should not be attempted unless absolutely necessary.E18 operated out of Reval through the autumn of 1915, departing on her first Baltic patrol on 21 September 1915. The following day she was in an excellent position to torpedo the German cruiser Bremen, but a surfaced Russian submarine caused the Bremen to turn away just as E18 was about to fire and the opportunity was lost; she returned to Reval on 29 September.\n\nParagraph 13: The meadow jumping mouse can range in length, from 180 mm to 240 mm, with its tail taking credit for most of its length, usually about 108 mm to 165 mm.  A distinct characteristic about this species is its enlarged hind feet, which can be 28 to 35 mm long, and relatively short forelimbs.  This gives it a kangaroo rat-like look, although its tail shows that it is not a kangaroo rat because it is not bushy at the tip.  The pelage of this creature is short, and with somewhat dense, coarse hair.  The color of the pelage has a few variations, but a broad dorsal stripe is always present.  This broad dorsal stripe is of a darker brown color, with black tips, giving it a somewhat a grayish appearance.  The sides are usually a lighter color, usually bright yellow to orange, and the under body is usually white, matching the color of its feet.  These mice have eight mammary glands, four inguinal, two pectoral, and two abdominal.  The male genitalia are inconspicuous except during mating season when the scrotal sac becomes enlarged and more visible.  The tail (which again makes up most of this creature's body length) is bicolored, showing a darker color from above and a lighter color below.  It is lightly covered with hair, which gets longer as it approaches the tip, but does not get bushy like the kangaroo rat.  Its ears are very noticeable, and its whiskers are prominent.  The head is small, and narrow, and it is considered to be relatively high crowned.  The nose is short, yet it is pointy, and the eyes are relatively big.  These mice also have a large infraorbital foramen.  With the exception of the Aye-Aye, the meadow jumping mouse is the only mammal to have eighteen teeth with a dental formula of: 1/1, 0/0, 1/0, and 3/3.  The upper jaw is short, and narrow.  The incisors are longitudinally grooved, and its cheek teeth are small.  Preceding the molars is a small peg-like premolar.  As a whole the female jumping mouse is slightly larger, and heavier than the male, but their weight varies quite a bit depending on the season. Their weight during summer seasons can range from 11.15 grams to 24. 8 grams, with an average at about 16 to 19 grams.  Just prior to hibernation, jumping mice can obtain a weight of 35 grams or larger.\n\nParagraph 14: The first season of Grey's received positive reviews from critics. In regard to the first season, New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a \"winner\", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating \"You simply can't stop watching!\" Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was \"so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land.\" The Washington Post's Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: \"The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different.\" He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode \"nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham-and-corn\", writing that overall: \"It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man.\" Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: \"When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead. That goes against conventional wisdom, which dictates that it's easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men.\" Review Stream gave positive reviews regarding the pilot episode, \"A Hard Day's Night\", due to the undeniable chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey from the series' first scene. Regarding Miranda Bailey's appearance in the pilot, ReviewStream.com stated \"She's such a small woman but wait until she speaks.\" HomeTheaterInfo.com, however, had a mixed perspectives on the pilot, noting that the storylines were similar to fellow ABC series Desperate Housewives, but also \"brilliantly written, extremely well-acted and directed to near perfection.\" IGN gave a positive review stating, \"The show isn't derivative, and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor, the characters resemble real people - who are fragile, and yes, fallible.\" and added, \"this facile description does little justice to the show's tightly-wound plotting, character subtleties, or masterful acting, it speaks to the intangible nature of what differentiates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, in network television.\"\n\nParagraph 15: Female. Forewing length 3.5 mm. Head: frons shining ochreous-white with greenish and reddish reflections, vertex and neck tufts dark brown with reddish gloss, medially and laterally lined white, collar dark brown; labial palpus first segment very short, white, second segment four-fifths of the length of third, brown with white longitudinal lines laterally and ventrally, third segment white, lined brown laterally; scape dark brown with a white anterior line, white ventrally, antenna shining dark brown with a white line from base to one-fifth, changing into an interrupted line to one-half, followed towards apex by a dark brown section of approximately eight segments, three white, two dark brown, two white, ten dark brown and eight white segments at apex. Thorax and tegulae dark brown with reddish gloss, thorax with a white median line, tegulae lined white inwardly. Legs: greyish brown, femora of midleg and hindleg shining pale grey, foreleg with a white line on tibia and tarsal segments, tibia of midleg with white oblique basal and medial lines and a white apical ring, tarsal segments one and two with white apical dorsal spots, segment five entirely white, tibia of hindleg as midleg, first tarsal segment with ochreous-white basal and apical rings, segments two to four with ochreous-white apical rings, segment five entirely ochreous-white, spurs white, ventrally with a dark grey streak. Forewing dark brown with reddish gloss, four white lines in the basal area, a subcostal from base to one-third, slightly bending from costa, a short and straight medial above fold from one-quarter to two-fifths, a subdorsal below fold, similar in length to the medial, but slightly further from base, a dorsal from beyond base to the middle of the subdorsal, a broad yellow transverse fascia beyond the middle with an apical protrusion, bordered at the inner edge by two golden metallic tubercular subcostal and subdorsal spots, the subcostal spot edged by a small patch of blackish brown scales on the outside, the subdorsal spot more towards apex than the subcostal, bordered at the outer edge by two similarly coloured costal and dorsal spots, the dorsal spot twice as large as the costal, both brownish edged on the inside, a broad white costal streak from the outer costal spot, a shining white apical line from just beyond the apical protrusion to apex, cilia dark brown around apex, brownish grey towards dorsum. Hindwing shining dark brownish grey, cilia brownish grey. Underside: forewing shining dark greyish brown, the white apical line distinctly visible, hindwing shining brownish grey. Abdomen dorsally shining brown with some reddish gloss, ventrally grey, segments banded shining yellowish white posteriorly, anal tuft greyish brown.\n\nParagraph 16: Eddy Gordo first appeared in Tekken 3 and appeared in the following title, Tekken Tag Tournament. In Tekken 4, Eddy Gordo was omitted from the roster and was replaced with Christie Monteiro, another Capoeira practitioner, but appeared as an alternate costume for Christie and without serving any purpose in the storyline. Masahiro Kimoto stated that Eddy was replaced because initially, they had intended to create a female Capoeira character in Tekken 3 but instead changed to a male character due to artistic limitations. In Tekken 4, the team was able to successfully create \"an attractive female character\" who practiced Capoeira, so they chose to replace Eddy with her. Eddy Gordo later served as a character costume swap for Christie in Tekken 5, and became a separate character once again in the Tekken 5 update, Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection; however, while he did have his own character customizations, his moveset remained identical to Christie's. Eddy Gordo appeared again in Tekken 6, and its update, Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion, but his moveset has remained similar to Christie's, only differing in move properties such as speed and distance. Additionally, in Bloodline Rebellion, Eddy serves as the boss for the 28th level of the Scenario Campaign Mode, the \"Tekken Force 4th Special Forces Operational Group Compound\".\n\nParagraph 17: Political campaigns and elections are featured in several episodes of The Simpsons. The season 2 episode \"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\" features Mr. Burns running for governor against a popular incumbent with the intention of relaxing safety regulations for his business. The career politician is portrayed as a favorable alternative that cares about the state in comparison to Mr. Burns, who only seeks office for his own benefit. The season 6 episode \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\" features a mayoral election, pitting incumbent Mayor Quimby against Sideshow Bob, a man who had attempted to kill Bart Simpson. The Simpsons help Quimby in his reelection campaign, but Sideshow Bob is elected. Sideshow Bob uses his political power to make life difficult for the Simpsons, but it is discovered that he won through electoral fraud. The season 9 episode \"Trash of the Titans\" follows Homer Simpson as he runs for the office of sanitation commissioner, portraying him as an everyman who is unqualified for the role. The season 14 episode \"Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington\" follows Krusty the Clown as he runs for Congress to fix a local issue through government regulation. In the season 19 episode \"E Pluribus Wiggum\", Springfield holds the earliest presidential primary, and the town nominates eight-year-old Ralph Wiggum to express their distaste for the ensuing media circus.\n\nParagraph 18: Michiel de Ruyter, since February 1673 Lieutenant-Admiral-General of the confederate Dutch fleet, planned to blockade the main English fleet in the Medway by sinking blockships in its narrowest part, then deal with the remaining English squadrons at his leisure. But the English fleet took to sea in time to prevent this operation, and De Ruyter retreated on 15 May to the Schooneveld, the coastal waters at the mouth of the Schelde River, near the island of Walcheren, to prevent the allies from establishing the naval superiority needed for the transport and landing of a force of 6,000 soldiers of the English Army waiting at Yarmouth. The Schooneveld basin, between two shoals, was so narrow the allies could not take advantage of their numerical superiority. There, De Ruyter was joined by Tromp, adding the squadrons of the admiralties of Amsterdam and the Northern Quarter to that of the Admiralty of de Maze and the Zealandic fleet. De Ruyter read a message from the stadtholder to his captains, informing them they were not only the champions of their nation but of the whole of Christendom and that for any cowards, \"the least safe place will be the ports of the State for there they shall escape neither the severe hand of Justice nor the curse and hatred of their compatriots\", many later being overheard repeating these words to themselves.\n\nParagraph 19: The film includes Byrne's \"big suit\", an absurdly large business suit that he wears for the song \"Girlfriend Is Better\". The suit was partly inspired by Noh theatre styles, and became an icon not only of the film – as it appears on the movie poster, for instance – but of Byrne himself. Byrne said: \"I was in Japan in between tours and I was checking out traditional Japanese theater – Kabuki, Noh, Bunraku – and I was wondering what to wear on our upcoming tour. A fashion designer friend (Jurgen Lehl) said in his typically droll manner, 'Well David, everything is bigger on stage.' He was referring to gestures and all that, but I applied the idea to a businessman's suit.\" Pauline Kael stated in her review: \"When he comes on wearing a boxlike 'big suit' – his body lost inside this form that sticks out around him like the costumes in Noh plays, or like Beuys' large suit of felt that hangs off a wall – it's a perfect psychological fit.\" On the DVD he gives his reasoning behind the suit: \"I wanted my head to appear smaller and the easiest way to do that was to make my body bigger, because music is very physical and often the body understands it before the head.\"\n\nParagraph 20: In 1996, Gerry O'Malley, the Minister of Science and Technology, proposed a plan to bury the Tar Ponds under slag procured from the steel mill. By this time, the project had attracted local critics, who condemned the plan. Also in 1996, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments jointly funded a community organization, the Joint Action Group (JAG), with a mandate to \"educate, involve and empower the community, through partnerships, to determine and implement acceptable solutions for Canada's worst hazardous waste site and to assess and address the impact on human health.\" The three governments also embarked on detailed environmental site assessments, and a variety of preliminary cleanup projects. Although JAG held more than 950 public meetings, no clear consensus on cleanup technologies emerged. Bruno Marcocchio, founder of the Citizen Liaison Committee, complained that the JAG was only being used \"to give credibility to back room, politically motivated manipulation.\" Governments, meanwhile, generated more than 620 technical and scientific reports on the problem, and possible solutions. Carl Buchanan, JAG's chairman, said: \"This is going to be the most complex environmental cleanup ever undertaken in this country, and maybe anywhere. It's never been done on this scale, and right in the middle of a city.\"\n\nParagraph 21: Julia grew up in an atmosphere which encouraged her political interests and her adoration for her home village. When she was little she had a lot of influences which drove her to her interest in politics. On her father' side she had relatives who were ministers of the nation during the first and the second republic. However, her father, who was the mayor of Pontevedra, was a monarchic man. She was educated by particular teachers, as in that time very few women received some type of education. Later, she liked music but her parents thought that she could have a more important occupation. When she became an adult and a married woman, she was a woman anticipated to her time, she was very liberal, independent and very interested in politics and her home village, Barrantes. Consequently, when she was married her parents gave her \"El Pazo de Barrantes\" where she spent all the summers. She was very interested in the people from Barrantes, the farmers, the poverty, the insolation and so on. Her friends had a political ideology which helped her to define her own ideology; that is, a mixture of pro-Galician feeling, pro-land reform movement and conservative ideas. Due to all these ideas she met Ramón Cabanillas, Cambó and José Sánchez Guerra. On 25 September 1930, several important galician intellectuals and Julia met in Pazo de Barrantes to write a document which demanded the rights of Galicia. This is known as the Barrantes agreement (Pacto de Barrantes). This contract was signed by Ramón Cabanillas, Paz Andrade, Basilio Álvarez and others..... except Julia because she was a woman. This caused her to have problems with her family and some of her politician friends. During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Julia Becerra, a woman with strong democratic convictions, was as dissatisfied with the dictatorship as her friend José Sánchez Guerra. Otherwise she had a good relationship with the general Primo de Rivera. As a consequence we can tell she was an open-minded woman, because she was friends with very different people. Julia, countess of Creixel, was always between the devil and the deep blue sea because although she was in favour of the Republic, she was a friend of the king Alfonso XIII too. Besides the people who met in Barrantes were not in favour of the republican regime because the contract was judged in a very different way outside Barrantes. After the republic reclamation Julia participated more in politics, for instance she ran as a deputy in the province of Pontevedra, although she was not elected. During the Spanish Civil war she had a lot of contacts in the republican party, so she helped a lot of people who had their lives in danger.She contributed to saving a considerable number of lives thanks to her links to the organization \"Socorro Blanco\" The Spanish Civil war was a hard time for everybody. Her granddaughter Cristina Cebrián explains that thanks to the Barrantes Palace's house keepers, Julia and her family never lacked food or money because they kept all her shares despite the war. Some years later, she renounced to give up politics when the Civil war finished with the democracy in Spain.\n\nParagraph 22: Based in the old Pacific Bell building on Rose Street at Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, California, Berkeley Systems grew to 120 employees and US$30 million annual revenue before it was acquired by the Sierra On-Line division of CUC International in 1997 for $13.8 million. Vivendi Universal’s subsequent acquisition of Sierra, and a host of similar enterprises, enjoined diverse competing sales and marketing departments with one sole directive: sell Web banner advertisements. As a result, Berkeley Systems became the U.S. headquarters of French-owned Flipside.com. In early 2000, Berkeley Systems was folded into the fledgling Los Angeles-based gambling site iWin.com, per the terms of that site's acquisition by Vivendi.\n\nParagraph 23: Price's men encamped south of Newtonia, in some woods near the McClain Farm. Some of the soldiers were sent into town to bring a flour mill into use. A report of approaching Union soldiers reached the Confederate camp, and Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson attempted to organize a group of soldiers of his brigade to meet the threat. Thompson was unable to convince many of the tired Confederates to break their rest, and was only able to get about 200 men to follow him.  When no Union soldiers arrived and straggling Confederate soldiers arrived to dispute the rumor, Thompson sent his men back to the camp. At around 14:00, Union soldiers under the command of Colonel James H. Ford arrived, having approached the battlefield from the northwest.  Ford deployed McLain's Colorado Battery and the 2nd Colorado and 16th Kansas Cavalry Regiments. The Confederates were harvesting corn when the Union troops arrived and their skirmishers were quickly driven away from their position west of the town near the Mathew H. Ritchey Farm.  While this action was occurring, Union Major General James G. Blunt arrived to take command of the action; he personally fought with the 16th Kansas Cavalry during this stage of the fighting.\n\nParagraph 24: In 1971, the Newfoundland Amateur Hockey Association jumped on board by allowing their provincial Junior champion to compete in the Centennial Cup playdowns.  This lasted until 1977.  Also in 1971, the Maritime Junior A Hockey League folded, leaving the Charlottetown Islanders (the defending Dudley Hewitt Cup champions) to enter the Centennial Cup playdowns as an independent team.  Also in 1971, the Newfoundland Junior A Hockey League entered the fray.  In 1972, the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association folded when two of its teams (Sudbury Wolves and Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds) jumped to Major Junior.  The Charlottetown Islanders closed their doors after a marginal performance in the 1972 playdowns.  Two new leagues came in 1972, the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League was created as a rival league to the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League.  The SOJHL was more in Southwestern Ontario, while the OPJHL focused more on the Greater Toronto Area.  The other new league was the Quebec Junior A Hockey League.\n\nParagraph 25: Kammo (Nargis) lives a wealthy lifestyle with her widowed multi-millionaire dad, Girhdari Lal (Gope). He would like her to marry someone who is not after their wealth. To his dismay, she chooses to marry a pilot named Sumankumar (Pran), who is known for womanizing and greed. When he disapproves, she runs away from home. The news of her running is announced on radio and newspaper offering a reward of 1.25 lakhs for her safe return. On the run, she decides to go by bus to meet Suman. A free-lance reporter Sagar (Raj Kapoor) in search of a story is also going to Bangalore to get advance from his editor. An auto owner cum driver Bhagwan sees the news of reward and goes with his wife to find Kammo. The first encounter of Kammo and Sagar in the bus starts with a tiff. After night's journey full of tiffs the bus stops for passengers to eat snacks. Kammo wanders off and Sagar sees the news of her running and thinks that it will be good story. She misses the bus and Sagar also let it go for his scoop. They catch the next bus, in the bus a poet (Johnny Walker) bores her by reciting his poems at that point Sagar comes to her rescue claiming to be her husband. Midway through the journey the bus breaks down and they take a room in Banwari's (David) inn where only married couples are allowed. They share room and make a partition of bed sheet. The comic situation brings them closer. Kammo spends all the money to buy toiletries, etc. They start walking the next 7 km to Bangalore. Kammo falls in love with the simple life of villages. They spent night in the open where Bhagwan spots them. In the confusion of the melee they escape with auto and take a room in Madarilal's (Mukri) inn with promise to clear rent on check out. The adventure of journey and facing situations together bonds them and they fall in love with each other. Deciding to marry Kammo, Sagar goes to Bangalore to get advance from his editor, leaving a note, while Kammo is still sleeping. The editor gives him cheque which takes time to cash. Meanwhile in the morning the Madarilal's wife humiliates Kammo and throws her out as she does not have money to pay. Kammo thinks that Sagar has abandoned her for story. She phones her father from a house and asks him to come and take her home. Coming back Sagar sees her motorcade going. He thinks she has left her. Both feel let down and dejected. He buys the auto from Bhagwan from advance money. \n\nParagraph 26: The old Hirsauer Kirche was originally the spiritual hub for all villages in the Eßweiler Tal. When it was that a church was first built in Hirsau (not to be confused with Hirsau in Baden-Württemberg) cannot be determined today. It can be assumed nonetheless that there had been an earlier church standing at the same spot centuries before the one that still stands now was built (about 1100); it may have been wooden. Churchgoers came from throughout the dale to attend services, all weddings were held there, and so were all funerals and burials. It was also the thingstead, and on certain days, market was held there, too. Hirsau lost this central role when in 1451 the church in Hinzweiler was built, although originally this only functioned as a chapel of ease to Hirsau's parish church. This actually brought about competition between the two churches in the time that followed for the function of parish church. As early as 1526, the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken introduced the Reformation into the church of the Oberamt of Meisenheim, replacing Catholic belief with Martin Luther’s teachings so that bit by bit, church services in the Eßweiler Tal, too, began to be conducted in accordance with the Reformation. The Offenbach Monastery, to which the Hinzweiler church was subject, at first opposed Reformist efforts. In 1555, though, the Rhinegraves of Grumbach, too, introduced the Reformation, and in 1588, the Offenbach Monastery was dissolved. In 1562, Eßweiler got its own graveyard. After the Counts Palatine of Zweibrücken had become absolute fiefholders over the Eßweiler Tal in 1795, worshippers then had to convert to Calvinism in line with developments in the County Palatine. Beginning in 1601, Hinzweiler became the temporary parish seat, but already by 1610, it once again had to yield this function to Hirsau, only to get it back after the Thirty Years' War. This structure remains in place to this day. In earlier days, Nerzweiler's inhabitants were mainly Reformed, according to John Calvin’s teachings. As minorities, there were Lutherans, who in 1818 merged with the Calvinists. Catholic Christians were not found in Nerzweiler until the early 19th century, and even thereafter, only sporadically. In 1743, out of 14 households, only two belonged to the Lutheran faith, while none belonged to either the Catholic or the Jewish faith. In 1825, only Protestants lived in the village, that is, former Calvinists and Lutherans after the 1818 Protestant Union. In 1961, among the 180 inhabitants was one Catholic.\n\nParagraph 27: During the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the Secret Empire storyline, Red Hulk stumbles upon the underground lair of Gorilla-Man and his army of Gorilla-Men. Gorilla-Man tries to remove Red Hulk's head in order to strengthen his Gorilla-Men army. Squirrel Girl manages to defeat Gorilla-Man and his army with her flying squirrels. Meanwhile, Steve Rogers has a meeting with Roberto da Costa and scolds him for his recent actions and Cannonball decides to quit the team so he could live with his wife Smasher and their son. Roberto then sees footage of the attacks in Manhattan, deep space, and in Sokovia. Cannonball returns to Earth only to discover the Alpha Flight Space Program, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Ultimates' battle against the Chitauri. He joins the heroes in battle until one of the Chitauri Dragons eats Quasar and explodes, leaving both him and Quasar to be presumed dead. When Roberto assembles the team, he is attacked by one of his scientists who has allied with Hydra. Meanwhile, the team arrives in Washington D.C. to confront Hydra when Red Hulk begins to attack them due to nanites that were injected in him, which starts to control him. When Pod and Squirrel Girl end up in Paris and are attacked by Hydra Agents, they are saved by the Champions of Europe consisting of Ares, Captain Britain, Excalibur, Guillotine, Outlaw, and Peregrine. Meanwhile, Cannonball is found by an alien, among the debris from the Chitauri battle, where it's revealed that he's still alive. Red Hulk and Iron Patriot are captured and imprisoned when they see a nearly dead Roberto in one of the cells. While adjusting to prison life, Toni manages to heal Roberto just in time, when Hydra soldiers show up at their cell. Meanwhile, Cannonball is sold at an auction to a human named Howard Mason and Squirrel Girl and Enigma help the Champions of Europe in raiding a Hydra base. At the prison, Roberto manages to use his powers to defeat the guards and free Red Hulk from the nanites controlling him, while Squirrel Girl, Enigma and the Champions of Europe defeat the Hydra soldiers in Paris by destroying a helicarrier and releasing other captured heroes. Cannonball is later brought to an Earth-like American small town named Glenbrook. In the aftermath of the event, Roberto resigns from A.I.M. and is visited by Smasher who tells him that Cannonball is still alive. Meanwhile, Toni deactivates the Hydra nanites in Red Hulk's blood enabling him to return to normal and gets asked by A.I.M. agents to be the organization's new leader and Squirrel Girl and Enigma are seen fighting the Plunderer and Blue Streak who were attempting to rob from the Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. facility.\n\nParagraph 28: The Mahabharata narrates that King Dushyanta was once hunting in the forests, when he struck a fawn with his arrow. The fawn fled to the ashrama of Sage Kanva, and the king followed it. Upon reaching the ashrama, the king saw Shakuntala watering the plants, accompanied by her friends, named Anasuya and Priyamvada. Dushyanta and Shakuntala fell in love with each other. Since the sage Kanva was absent from the ashrama, they married according to the gandharva rites, and Shakuntala soon became pregnant. The king presented her with his signet ring, and left for his palace. When Dushyanta left Shakuntala, she grew pensive, and did not realise the arrival of Durvasa to the ashrama. Reputed for his anger, Durvasa took her ignorance of him as a sign of disrespect, and cursed her to be forgotten by the man she was contemplating at that very moment. Shakuntala did not hear this curse being placed upon her. When Kanva returned and learnt of these events, he sent Shakuntala to the palace of Dushyanta. Owing to the curse, Dushyanta did not recognised her. Greatly aggrieved, while Shakuntala was returning to the ashrama, her mother, Menaka, took her to the ashrama of Kashyapa. Shakuntala delivered a son. The boy grew brave and fearless, and was able to subdue even the wildest of beasts in the region. Kashyapa, therefore, named him Sarvadamana (all-subduing). After a period of time, when Dushyanta was returning home after visiting Indra, he came across Shakuntala, recognised her, and took her and his son to his palace. This boy grew up to become Bharata. Bharata conquered the world, and acquired three wives, though the sons born of these wives were so cruel that they were slain. Bharata propitiated the devas for a son, and they gave him a boy, whom he named Vitatha, also called Bharadvaja. According to another account, Bharadvaja blessed Bharata with a son named Bhumanyu. Bharata ruled for twenty-seven thousand years, and therefore, the kingdom that he inherited and expanded came to be known as Bhārata, named after him.\n\nParagraph 29: In 1888 the Fine Art Society planned an exhibition on birds and Marks decided to use this opportunity to take up an intensive study of birds and he became a regular visitor at the zoo. In 1890 he had a private exhibition on his bird works. As his career progressed, he became increasingly interested in painting birds. Possibly his most famous painting is A Select Committee (1891) which is now in the Walker Art Gallery. He was elected as a member of the Royal Academy following his painting Convocation, which was exhibited in 1878. Both of these demonstrated his interest in birds, in the former parrots and in the latter adjutant storks and in general his paintings depicted large birds and the colourful parrots and he visited the London Zoo regularly to observe them. His early works were in oil (The Convent Raven, 1870) but many of his paintings of birds were watercolours, which he exhibited at the Old Watercolour Society or at the Fine Art Society. St Francis Preaching to the Birds (1870), was first sold for sold for £450 and seven years later for £1155. His diploma work Science is measurement depicting a scientist with measuring instruments before the skeleton of an adjutant stork is considered a classic. He got the idea of painting this scene while taking measurements for his earlier paintings. \"In making studies of the birds, I went to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons to take measurements of the bones, their proportionate length, &c. When I had obtained what information I needed, I came away, and crossing Lincoln's Inn Fields, it struck me that the occupation in which I had been engaged would furnish a good subject for the picture.\" To paint this picture he asked for advice on obtaining a skeleton of the adjutant stork from Sir William Flower that could be kept at home so that he could study it at leisure. Flower suggested a taxidermy artist and skeleton preparer in Camden Town who supplied him with a suitable specimen. Marks ensured that he counted the vertebrae and measured them carefully to make sure it was accurate. The title was decided after much discussion with artists and scientists and he submitted it as his diploma picture for the Royal Academy of Arts. Abraham Dee Bartlett, superintendent at the London zoo, encouraged him to draw birds with accuracy rather than colour them with anthropomorphism. In later years he painted landscapes and seascapes based on studies in Southwold and Walberswick.\n\nParagraph 30: Folk/avant-garde guitarist John Fahey recorded several songs in the early 1960s that experimented with unusual recording techniques, including backward tapes, and novel instrumental accompaniment.  His nineteen-minute \"The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party\" \"anticipated elements of psychedelia with its nervy improvisations and odd guitar tunings\". Other songs from Fahey's The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party & Other Excursions (recorded between 1962 and 1966) also used \"unsettling moods and dissonances\" that took them beyond the typical folk fare. In 1967, he performed with the psychedelic/avant-garde/noise rock band Red Krayola (then Red Crayola) at the Berkeley Folk Festival which was recorded and later released as Live 1967.  Among other descriptions, their performance has been likened to early Velvet Underground bootlegs and \"the very weirdest parts of late-'60s Pink Floyd pieces (like the shrieking guitar scrapes of 'Interstellar Overdrive')\".\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nIn the film, David Byrne wears a large business suit called the \"big suit\" during the song \"Girlfriend Is Better\". The suit was partly inspired by traditional Japanese theater styles and became an iconic symbol not only in the film but also for Byrne himself. Byrne explained that the idea for the suit came from a fashion designer friend who suggested that everything is bigger on stage, and he applied this concept to a businessman's suit. Film critic Pauline Kael described the suit as a perfect fit psychologically, comparing it to the costumes in Noh plays and the large suit of felt by artist Beuys. Byrne himself explained that he wore the big suit to make his head appear smaller, as he believed that music is a physical experience that the body often understands before the mind.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: From its inception, the Carson and Colorado was a hindrance to the Virginia and Truckee Railroad (V&T), the parent company of the C&C, who sold the line to the Southern Pacific Company in 1900. Darius Ogden Mills (part owner) was once quoted saying \"Either we built the line 300 miles too long, or 300 years too early!\" Silver and gold discoveries at Tonopah, Nevada and Goldfield, Nevada provided a major boost of revenues shortly after the Southern Pacific purchase. From the time of the purchase until 1905, all of the C&C’s freight traveled over the V&T's trackage from Mound House to Reno, and vice versa. Because of the changeover from  narrow gauge to standard gauge cars, all the freight had to be handled by hand at Mound House, which caused a great bottleneck, especially after the mining booms of Tonopah and Goldfield. Southern Pacific (SP) proffered an offer to purchase the V&T, but the price was placed too high. As a result, the SP began constructing the Hazen cutoff, which circumvented the V&T entirely after it opened. The northern  from Mound House to Mina, Nevada was converted to  in 1905; and the remaining C&C was merged into the Southern Pacific's  narrow gauge subsidiary, the Nevada and California Railroad. The Nevada and California Railroad was reorganized into the Central Pacific Railroad in 1912. In the early 20th century, it operated under the name \"Southern Pacific Keeler Branch\". Portions of the line were abandoned in the 1930s and the 1940s, and the last narrow gauge common carrier made its final run on April 29, 1960. The rails were removed in January, 1961.\n\nParagraph 2: Having crossed the Rhine, both army groups fanned out into the German hinterland. In the south, while the Third Army headed east, the First Army headed northeast and formed the southern pincer of the Ruhr envelopment. In the north, the Ninth Army, which since the Battle of the Bulge had been assigned to the 21st Army Group, headed southeast, forming the northern pincer, while the rest of the 21st Army Group went east and northeast. Even before the encirclement was complete, Allied activity against the Ruhr had a critical impact on Germany's economy—on March 26 Joseph Goebbels noted in his diary that no more coal was coming from the Ruhr.\n\nParagraph 3: The Queen's College, Oxford established the Neda Agha-Soltan Graduate Scholarship in 2009, named after Neda Agha-Soltan, who died in the protests that followed the election.  This led to a letter of protest to the college from the Iranian embassy in London, signed by the deputy ambassador, Safarali Eslamian. The letter disputed the circumstances of her death, and said that there was \"supporting evidence indicating a pre-made scenario\". Eslamain wrote, \"It seems that the University of Oxford has stepped up involvement in a politically motivated campaign which is not only in sharp contract with its academic objectives, but also is linked with a chain of events in post-Iranian presidential elections blamed for British interference both at home and abroad\".  The letter also said that the \"decision to abuse Neda's case to establish a graduate scholarship will highly politicise your academic institution, undermining your scientific credibility—along with British press which made exceptionally a lot of hue and cry on Neda's death—will make Oxford at odd  with the rest of the world's academic institutions.\" Eslamain asked for the university's governing board to be informed of \"the Iranian views\", and finished by saying, \"Surely, your steps to achieve your attractions through non-politically supported programs can better heal the wounds of her family and her nation.\"  Following publication of the Iranian letter, The Times was told by UK diplomatic sources, speaking anonymously, that the scholarship had put \"another nail into the coffin\" of relations between Britain and Iran.  If the government had been asked, the sources were reported as saying, it would have advised against the move, because it was felt that Iran would see it as an act of provocation, and because it would interfere with efforts to free Iranians working for the British Embassy in Tehran who had been detained for alleging participating in the post-election protests. A college spokesman said that the scholarship had not been set up as part of a political decision, and if the initial donations had been refused, this would have been interpreted as a political decision too.\n\nParagraph 4: Between 1996 and 2009, the mast provided BBC One Wales and S4C to most of the town's residents. Its transmissions utilised spare UHF capacity in which to relay transmissions from the Moel-y-Parc transmitting station on low power (via another similar relay in nearby Bagillt). Due to limited capacity, it was not possible for the site to carry BBC Two Wales or ITV1 Wales. Owing to the constraints of local geography and location of the main Moel-y-Parc transmitter, residents in the town and some surrounding areas had previously been unable to fully access Welsh television output (provided in both the Welsh and English languages). Reception of the Welsh TV stations varied from poor to un-viewable and as a consequence programming was supplied almost exclusively by the North West of England-based TV stations such as ITV1 Granada, easily receivable with a set top aerial. As Flint falls outside the normal coverage area of these TV stations, reference in local programming was rarely ever made to the area. The relay was only installed following a campaign spearheaded by the Welsh-language group Teledu I Pawb (). The group considered the bias toward North West of England regional TV programming across many parts of the North Wales coastal strip unacceptable and detrimental to the preservation and promotion of the Welsh Language, culture and national identity. Similar relays were installed at the same time in the nearby Village of Bagillt and the Town of Holywell. The latter also transmits BBC Radio Cymru. It is estimated that the three relays have made available Welsh regional TV programming to some 24,000 to 30,000 residents. A number of nearby localities remained without any terrestrial access to Welsh TV and radio output including Mostyn and Fynnongroyw. Viewers (and listeners) in these areas (and indeed across the UK) were, however, able to pick up all the Welsh TV and radio output via Sky satellite.\n\nParagraph 5: In fact Manilva has a very busy calendar of ferias and fiestas either religious, traditional or modern. Starting off with the Three Kings cavalcade on 5 January, then the raucous fun of Carnival around the beginning of Lent; the solemn devotion of the Semana Santa processions during Easter; the Manilva International Festival, around the end of May, during which the municipality's international community takes the opportunity to show off its varying culture, cuisine and traditions; Saint John's Eve during the Summer solstice with its pagan tradition of Bonfires of Saint John, fireworks and partying till dawn; the fishermen's celebration of their patron, the Virgen del Carmen in mid-July, and then rounding off the summer with the Vendimia, in the first weekend of September, a festival celebrating Manilva's grape harvest. Throw into that a good smattering of Saints’ days and pilgrimages and you've got a busy schedule of partying and celebrations.\n\nParagraph 6: The town of Nyanza requires a turn off the main road that connects Kigali to Butare. Nyanza is a -hour bus ride from Kigali, a -hour bus ride to Muhanga, a one-hour bus ride to Huye, a 30-minute bus ride to Ruhango and a 16-minute bus ride to Gatagara. The bus station is in the center of Nyanza town, next to the covered outdoor market. The main bus companies serving Nyanza are Volcano and Horizon, which leave every half hour and seat about 28 passengers. There are also smaller vans known as Twegerane buses that fit in as many people as possible and depart when full. Transportation within the town is via the ubiquitous moto (motorcycle) taxis or bicycle taxis, or by foot.\n\nParagraph 7: Manigault was particularly famous for his leaping abilities on the basketball court. However much of his legend is unsupported playground myth, including his signature move - the double dunk. He allegedly would dunk the ball, catch it with his left hand, switch the ball to his right hand, bring it back around to the top of the basket and jam it through again, all done while still in the air on a single jump, and without hanging on the rim. However this is a story repeatedly told but unconfirmed. It was refuted by Manigault himself in a CNN interview available on YouTube when he called the reports of this feat rubbish, stating not even The Goat could do that. Like other street basketballers of the day such as Jackie Jackson, Earl was reportedly able to touch the top of the backboard to retrieve quarters and dollar bills, part of \"elaborate innovations and tricks\" elite street players of the era performed before games to help build their reputations. Again, this has never been confirmed. Like the dunking myth, it is always referred to as \"reportedly\" without a credible source to support it. It is refuted in Todd Gallagher's book \" Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan.\"  The book dedicates an entire chapter to this myth concluding it was never done by Manigault or anyone else, including NBA stars. Gallagher writes \" Earl \"The Goat\" Manigault is widely regarded as one of the greatest playground basketball players of all time. There are a number of tales regarding Manigault's prowess, but the central story that propelled his legend was that he had such extraordinary leaping ability he could pull dollar bills off the top of the backboard and leave change. What made this even more amazing was that Manigault was, depending on who you talk to, somewhere between 5-11 and 6-1. Considering that the top of the backboard is at thirteen feet and the average six-foot-tall man can only touch about eight feet high standing flat-footed, Manigault would have had to jump at least sixty inches to even come close. He was only 6' 1\", but attributed his tremendous jumping ability to having in childhood often worn ankle weights during practice.  (Such efficacy of ankle weights is doubtful, however.) He once reverse dunked 36 times in a row to win a $60 bet.\n\nParagraph 8: Boston was described as \"[A] glowing chestnut, with a blazed face and both hind ankles white; his coat being lustrous and satiny in texture. While well-shaped, the expression of his head and neck were such that they were often though coarse and ugly, which actually they were not. The eye was large and full, the ear small and well-placed and carried, the nostril flaring. His neck was of medium length and very clean at the throttle. He rose high on the withers, was deep-breasted and the shoulders obliquely laid. For a horse of his height his carcass was immense. He was slab-sided, flat-bodied and stood over a lot of ground, his back-ribs were wonderful and coupling arched with the power of suspension bridge, while his entire hind quarter was a prodigy of brawn and muscle. Boston was a heavy limbed horse, with knees and hocks let down close the ground and unusually short pasterns that were at the same time extremely flexible. No set of measurements seems ever to have been taken of him, but his forearm was abnormal in its size, as were his stifle and gaskin, his length from point of hip to point of hock superior to any other celebrity since American Eclipse. His fiery temperament alternately flamed and smouldered and from moods of passion he would lapse into inert, sluggish ones, but at all times he had the quickness of a cat when aroused which made his gigantic strength all the more formidable. Led out he usually dropped his head almost on a level with his withers; and at the beginning of a heat carried it so low that he seemed to stretch himself along the ground, but as the miles were put behind him and the climax came, would gradually lift it higher and higher and finish 'looking for horses.'\"\n\nParagraph 9: After the team's highly successful run the previous year, Bayern management deferred to Van Gaal's assessment that no further transfers were needed in the run-up to the 2010–11 season. However, some players who had already been transferred away on a loan basis the year before, such as Luca Toni and José Sosa, were sold outright. Returning loanee Toni Kroos, who had also spent the last one-and-a-half years at Bayer Leverkusen, was the only notable \"addition\" to the squad. Bayern again had to deal with a string of injuries that befell key players, most notably Robben, who missed the whole first leg of the season due to a harmstring injury that he had picked up when preparing for the 2010 World Cup with the Netherlands. The team got off to a very poor start in the league, only securing eight points out of its first seven Bundesliga games and quickly conceding a substantial lead to eventual champions Borussia Dortmund. Hampered by consistently weak showings in its defence, Bayern finished the first half of the season in fifth place, 14 points behind leaders Dortmund. The winter transfer period saw the addition of Luiz Gustavo from 1899 Hoffenheim against the departures of captain Mark van Bommel to Milan and central defender Martín Demichelis to Málaga. While Bayern performed much better during the season's second half, securing the most league points of all teams, Dortmund's lead would eventually prove insurmountable. At the European level, Bayern looked poised to exact revenge on Internazionale for their Champions League final loss the year before, but despite a 1–0 away victory, the team exited the competition after a 2–3 home loss. Having already agreed to terminate his contract at the end of the season, Van Gaal was ultimately sacked outright on 10 April. Former assistant coach Andries Jonker took over the team and managed to win third place in the league, achieving the minimum aim of reaching a Champions League qualification spot.\n\nParagraph 10: Billboard announced that a new airplay-measuring system for its music charts would be based on Nielsen ratings beginning on November 12, 1994. \"No Me Queda Más\" entered the US Hot Latin Songs chart at number 40 on that date, and Selena's \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" remained at number one. On November 19, the song rose to number ten on that chart and subsequently debuted on the US Regional Mexican Airplay chart at number seven. The following week, it climbed to the fifth and fourth positions on the Hot Latin Songs and Regional Mexican Airplay charts, respectively. Billboard contributor John Lannert, noting that three different songs had topped the Hot Latin Songs chart since the inception of the Nielsen-rating system, predicted that Luis Miguel's number one single \"La Media Vuelta\" could be unseated by \"No Me Queda Más\". The following week, \"La Media Vuelta\" remained atop the chart and \"No Me Queda Más\" rose to number two. \"No Me Queda Más\" topped the Regional Mexican Airplay chart for three consecutive weeks beginning on December 3, Selena's first number one on that chart. The song peaked at number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart on December 17, her third consecutive number one. It debuted at number 13 on the US Latin Pop Songs chart on January 7, 1995, remaining atop the Hot Latin Songs chart. The song reclaimed the number-one spot on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart for January 14, unseating La Mafia's \"Me Duele Estar Solo\". La Mafia displaced \"No Me Queda Más\" from the top of the Regional Mexican Airplay and Hot Latin Songs charts on January 21, ending the song's five-week reign on the latter. The following week, \"No Me Queda Más\" regained the top of both charts. On February 4, it fell to number two on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart and retained the top spot on the Hot Latin Songs chart for its seventh nonconsecutive week. It was displaced from the top of the Hot Latin Songs chart on February 11 by Grupo Bronco's \"Que No Me Olvide\". It was the most popular song from Amor Prohibido on Mexican radio.\n\nParagraph 11: In the criterion validation study, responses to Whetstone's questionnaire of 53 survivors of car accidents were compared to those of 24 normal controls. There was no overlap between the score distribution in the group of patients (lowest score was 23) and the control group (highest score was 19). The patients’ scores ranged from 23 to 93, with the average at 65.5 (SD=17.4) and those in a control group ranged from 0 to 19, with the average at 6.8 (SD=5.1). The convergent validity was also very satisfactory: high correlations were found of Whetstone questionnaire to the Driving Anxiety Questionnaire (r=.80) and to the PCL-5 measure of PTSD symptoms (r=.78). Whetstone scores were found to be also highly correlated with the post-concussion syndrome (r=.63) and moderately with whiplash symptoms (r=.46), post-accident insomnia (r=.56), ratings of post-accident pain (rs ranging from .43 to .50), and ratings of depression (r=.40) and of generalized anxiety (r=.43). Significant correlation was also found of Whetstone to Steiner's Automobile Anxiety Inventory (r=.45). Whetstone's article also provides the full text of the Driving Anxiety Questionnaire (DAQ) that consists of a list of driving situations that are rated by the patient on a scale from \"No Anxiety\" to \"Severe Anxiety.\" This list consists of 14 situational items which the patient at first rates as a driver and then again separately as a passenger. The DAQ also includes 6 items describing behaviors indicative of anxiety as a driver and 7 items as a passenger. The study by Whetstone et al. reported also psychometric findings on the DAQ: its coefficients of convergent validity were satisfactory. The DAQ is especially well suited for behavior therapists for designing an individualized exposure therapy for each particular patient. A noteworthy part of this questionnaire is its measure of the phantom brake syndrome (the passenger's partly involuntary or unintended pressing the foot on the floor of the car in a reflexive attempt \"to brake\"; this reaction is common in skilled drivers who survived car accidents when travelling in the passenger seat). The article by Whetstone et al. also reviews the Automobile Anxiety Inventory (AAI) developed in Ontario by Leon Steiner. Steiner's AAI is a 23 item questionnaire of which 18 such are scored on a dichotomous basis (1=Yes, 0=No). Its convergent validity is adequate. Most of the AAI items compare the level of driving anxiety before the accident to the one after the accident. The AAI is written in relatively simple English. Steiner's AAI questionnaire is especially well suited for patients who read rarely or only reluctantly or for those with only elementary knowledge of written English. Since each of these 3 questionnaires (i.e., Whetstone's, Steiner's, and the DAQ) has a slightly different focus, it is often of advantage to use all 3 jointly in clinical assessments, as long as enough time is available.\n\nParagraph 12: Though initially hostile towards Reese, Sarah grows to trust him as he becomes the only thing between her and the Terminator. The two grow closer as they continue to run from the Terminator and Kyle eventually reveals that he volunteered for the mission. Though battle-hardened and world-weary, Reese had fallen deeply in love with Sarah, a woman he had only known through a photo given to him by John, and travelled back in time to meet her. After Reese tells Sarah of this history, the two consummate their relationship and ultimately conceive John. The Terminator tracks them down and chases them through Los Angeles; Reese is wounded by gunfire but manages to blow up a fuel truck driven by the Terminator before it can run over Sarah. However, its now-bare metal endoskeleton emerges from the fire and pursues them into an automated factory. Reese attempts to fight the Terminator but is overpowered, though he manages to wedge the last of his homemade pipe bombs into its chassis and set it off; the explosion kills Reese and blows the Terminator apart. The machine's upper body continues to crawl after Sarah, who crushes it with a hydraulic press to stop it once and for all.\n\nParagraph 13: China has taken part in the Chess Olympiads since 1978, the first in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was here that the Chinese soon put themselves on the map when one of their players, Liu Wenzhe, rated a mere 2200, defeated in spectacular style with a stunning queen sacrifice a top Western Grandmaster, the hapless Jan Hein Donner of The Netherlands, in just 20 moves. Since then, China has made rapid progress with the women's team taking the bronze medal and the men's team coming sixth at the 1990 Olympiad. At the Novi Sad FIDE Congress in 1990 China was awarded the status of \"one-zone federation\" (3.5), a decision which was inevitable given the various game-throwing scandals in the 1980s which made China's position in the Asia-Pacific zone untenable. Nonetheless, despite having only one Grandmaster, it was already clear that China would soon be worthy of their own zone. In Novi Sad the Chinese open team beat or drew with some of the strong teams and finished 18th. China's women went on to retain their position in the next two Olympiads and in 1996 won the silver medals. Meanwhile, the open team never have ranked below 15th place. In December, 1980, three Chinese teenage girls made their debut. They drew with the world champion USSR Team in the Chess Olympiad and tied for 5th place. In later Chess Olympiads, held every two years, China continued to make progress. At the 27th Chess Olympiad held in Dubai, UAE, they tied for 3rd place. Chinese Woman Grandmaster, Liu Shilan, who played on the first board ranked third of that board, was granted the Best Player. China Women's Team surprisingly won over several tough games with teams such as former World Runner-up, Bulgaria and former World Bronze Medalist, Romania. And they lost the game with USSR Team only by 1 to 2. China open team also got prominent results in the past two sessions of the Chess Olympiad. The team tied for 8th place in the 26th Chess Olympiad in 1984. In the 27th Chess Olympiad held in 1986, where 108 teams participated, they drew the former World Champion, Yugoslavia team and tied for 5th place with Bulgaria and Iceland by 9 victories, 1 draw and 4 losses. This was the highest place ever achieved by an Asian open team at an Olympiad. The best result in the past was 11th place achieved by the Philippines.\n\nParagraph 14: Rolling Meadows High School, RMHS, is a public four-year high school located in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, a northwest suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is part of Township High School District 214, the second largest high school district in Illinois, after Township High School District 211. The other five schools include Buffalo Grove High School, Elk Grove High School, John Hersey High School, Prospect High School, and Wheeling High School. It serves primarily central and east Rolling Meadows (east of Route 53), a significant part of Arlington Heights and a small part of Mount Prospect. Its feeder schools are South Middle School, Holmes Junior High School, Carl Sandburg Junior High School, and Our Lady of the Wayside, a private Catholic school.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1997, he received the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis (\"Scholl Siblings Prize\") for his book, Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer (Auschwitz, Nazi Medicine and Their Victims). In 2001, the city of Frankfurt am Main honored Klee with the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt for his book, Deutsche Medizin im Dritten Reich. Karrieren vor und nach 1945 (German Medicine in the Third Reich. Careers before and after 1945). The explanation states that Klee's works \"are suitable to support civil freedom, moral and intellectual courage, and to give important impetus to current awareness.\" Klee's commitment to the importance of disabled people was the decisive factor in the former Westfälische Schule für Körperbehinderte (Westphalian School for the Physically Disabled) in Mettingen being renamed the Ernst-Klee-Schule in his honor in 2005.\n\nParagraph 16: The Originals, often called \"Motown's best-kept secret\", were a successful Motown R&B and soul group during the late 1960s and the 1970s, most notable for the hits \"Baby I'm for Real\", \"The Bells\", and the disco classic \"Down to Love Town.\" Formed in 1966, the group originally consisted of baritone singer Freddie Gorman, tenor/falsetto Walter Gaines, and tenors C. P. Spencer and Hank Dixon (and briefly Joe Stubbs). Ty Hunter replaced Spencer when he left to go solo in the early 1970s. They had all previously sung in other Detroit groups, Spencer having been an original member of the (Detroit) Spinners and Hunter having sung with the Supremes member Scherrie Payne in the group Glass House. Spencer, Gaines, Hunter, and Dixon (at one time or another) were also members of the Voice Masters. As a member of the Holland–Dozier–Gorman writing-production team (before Holland–Dozier–Holland), Gorman (as a mailman) was one of the co-writers of Motown's first number 1 pop hit \"Please Mr. Postman\", recorded by the Marvelettes. In 1964 the Beatles released their version and in 1975 the Carpenters took it to number 1 again. This was the second time in pop history that a song had reached number 1 twice as \"The Twist\" by Chubby Checker, reached number 1 in both 1960 and 1961. In 2006, \"Please Mr. Postman\" was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nParagraph 17: After the closure, the two WG Bagnall built locomotives were sold to the North Negros Sugar Company of Iloilo in the Philippines. They were first used to transport cut sugar cane to nearby sugar mills, and later for track maintenance and shunting work. In 1990, they were decommissioned, and in 1995 acquired by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation and brought back to Hong Kong. One was cosmetically restored and is now on display in the Hong Kong Railway Museum. The second was donated by the Corporation to the Phyllis Rampton Narrow Gauge Railway Trust in 2007. It is now in England for restoration to working condition and may run on the Vale of Rheidol Railway in Wales.\n\nParagraph 18: Damon Evans was replaced by Greg McGarity, a Georgia alum and Associate AD at the University of Florida, in 2010. McGarity's tenure as Georgia's AD was one that saw a great surge in fundraising prowess, but much of that money was put away into what fans would derisively call, \"The Rainy Day Fund,\" a reserve fund of money that would grow to $100M that McGarity would not spend on improving facilities in a manner fans believed he should, as other Athletics Associations in the SEC, such as the Alabama Crimson Tide, were doing. This refusal to improve Georgia's football facilities in particular would derisively become known as, \"The Georgia Way,\" among disappointed fans who saw their football team fall behind Nick Saban's Crimson Tide in every conceivable way. McGarity oversaw the eventual firing of Georgia coaches in the three most important so-called \"money sports\": Dave Perno, Mark Richt, and Mark Fox, and in the instance of Perno and Fox, McGarity replaced them with coaches who have underperformed compared to the previous coach. He would also have to hire a replacement for Georgia Gymnastics legend Suzanne Yoculan during his time as AD, only to fire his first replacement and his second hire also fairing poorly. In replacing Richt, McGarity originally looked to hire Dan Mullen, who he knew from his time at Florida, but was eventually overruled by influential boosters who wanted Kirby Smart. As can be seen by the majority of McGarity's coaching hires, most of whom have fared poorly, hiring Mullen would have been a mistake as Smart is the most recent coach to win the College Football Playoff National Championship, the first Georgia Football National Title in 41 years, and Mullen was recently fired as the head coach at Florida. Kirby Smart came to Georgia from the successful Alabama football program, and did so with a list of demands for facilities improvements and a recruiting apparatus and budgetary overhaul that McGarity was not willing to provide Richt, but was happy to provide now for Smart.\n\nParagraph 19: The 21st century has also seen an increase in the number of independent children's music artists, with acts like The Dirty Sock Funtime Band, Dan Zanes, Parachute Express, Cathy Bollinger, Laurie Berkner and Lah-Lah getting wide exposure on cable TV channels targeted to children. Trout Fishing in America has achieved much acclaim continuing the tradition of merging sophisticated folk music with family-friendly lyrics. Father Goose Music known as The King Of The Dance Party gives a mixture of Ska, Reggae, calypso and Hip-Hop while Secret Agent 23 Skidoo infuses hip-hop with family friendly messages and imaginative stories and is known as \"The King of Kid-Hop\". Also recently, traditionally rock-oriented acts like They Might Be Giants have released albums marketed directly to children, such as No! and Here Come the ABCs. Jimmy Buffett simply remade his \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" song into children's music with cleaned up lyrics (\"Root Beer\" instead of \"Draft Beer\").  His songs were already kid friendly with catchy lyrics and simple melodies punctuated with penny whistles and ship bell sound effects. Conversely, Koo Koo Kanga Roo, a children-oriented comedy synthpop duo, made a successful crossover from performing children's events into touring with adult rock and punk bands such as Reel Big Fish and Frank Turner. In Canada, artists such as The Kerplunks and The Oot n' Oots have paved modern pathways to the genre following in the footsteps of Raffi, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois & Bram.\n\nParagraph 20: Roger Ebert called it a \"fun\" movie and gave it a rating of 2.5 out of 4. He criticised the pacing as cluttered and unfocused, and concluded \"It's a film you enjoy in pieces, but the jigsaw never gets solved.\" The New Yorkers Bruce Diones called it \"more surprising and effective than the usual kiddie-matinée madness.\" John Anderson of Variety wrote: \"Sprinkled with tongue-in-cheek humor, fairly adult jokes and some well-known faces acting very silly, this adventure story should have particular appeal to fans of The Princess Bride, but in any event will never be mistaken for a strictly-for-kids movie.\" Anderson praised Pfeiffer for her comedic timing and called De Niro's performance \"as engrossing as a car crash\". He says the romance is the least interesting part of the film, but the sweep of the story and the humor keep the film together. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote: \"Michelle Pfeiffer is Lamia, as deliciously evil a witch as the movies have ever invented\" and suggested she should be the center of the film. Holden said that Danes was miscast, and described De Niro's performance as \"either a piece of inspired madcap fun or an excruciating embarrassment.\" Kurt Loder of MTV News was critical of De Niro's performance saying \"This could be the most pointlessly grotesque performance of De Niro's career; it's flabbergastingly unfunny.\" Michael Dwyer of The Irish Times described the film as \"diverting in its whimsical way, but burdened with nonsequiturs, and it ought to have been subjected to more rigorous pruning in the editing suite\". Dwyer criticised the cameos of Gervais and De Niro as unsubtle, jarring, and self-indulgent, and said Danes was miscast. He praised Pfeiffer, saying she gave the film \"the kiss of life\". Dan Jolin of Empire magazine called it \"Patchy but great fun, peppering plenty of black humour into a sweet if silly fairy-tale romance.\" Glenn Kenny of Premiere called it \"an eye-poppingly elaborate fantasy that's shot through with action-movie adrenaline and attitude.\" Time Out London compared the film to Time Bandits or The Princess Bride \"but it lacks the former's originality and the latter's heart\". Tim Robey of The Telegraph wrote: \"There's a shameless romantic streak here, quite welcome in a boy-targeted genre that usually insists battles are cool and love is for wimps.\"\n\nParagraph 21: After attaining success throughout Europe with their album S.I.O.S.O.S., Vol. 1, Spooks garnered a hit with the single, \"Things I've Seen\", which featured in the Laurence Fishburne film Once in the Life (2000) as well as the intro for the European version of the American TV series Dark Angel.  Shortly afterwards, Spooks followed up with the number 16 on the top 40 charts hit \"Karma Hotel.\" Spooks had sold several million records internationally and was eligible for a European platinum plaque. They also reached gold status in five countries. Back home in America, \"Things I`ve Seen\" hit number 11 on the hip hop singles charts and \"Sweet Revenge\" hit number 6 on the r&b singles charts. Water-Water left the group before their second album Faster Than You Know, and died in a car accident in September 2003, days before the album's release. The group never actually disbanded. Hypno, Ming Xia and Mr. Booka T formed Tongue Productions in 2002 and  produced tracks and wrote choruses that were placed with other acts  under the supervision of Riggs Morales at Shady Records. In 2007 the Spooks drifted apart to tackle new ventures but never officially called it quits. In 2009 Ming Xia appeared on Chali 2na's Fish Outta Water as well as AZ`s single \"Super Star\", all of which choruses and Bridges were written by Tongue Productions. In 2022, Mr. Booka T had changed his name to TUCK 88 and dropped the new single \"Beautiful Ghetto\" featuring Hypno as Mr. Chenjerai. Fun Fact: Beautiful Ghetto was actually written for a film soundtrack and later slated to be on the Spooks third album; which amount to about thirty unreleased tracks. TUCK 88 also released a track by his daughter N`Dea titled, \"No Daisies\". N`Dea had studied under the tutelage of Ming Xia and had first appeared on the Spooks song \"Dead Beat\" when she was only three years old. Spooks were discovered by Philadelphia hip-hop legend \"Parry P\", who signed them to the Antra Records, where he was the Vice President of A&R.\n\nParagraph 22: 2008 proved to be Van Barneveld's most barren year thus far in the PDC in terms of success, with him not winning a major tournament. His defence of the World Championship crown was seriously thwarted by a bout of flu. He managed to win his first two matches comfortably, although he nearly had to retire during his second-round match due to breathing problems. He was defeated by Kevin Painter in the 3rd round by 4 sets to 2. Following this, he reached the semi-finals of the 2008 Premier League Darts, but was defeated for the third consecutive year at this stage of the tournament, defeated by James Wade. He was also knocked out of the early stages of the US Open, the Las Vegas Desert Classic by Alan Tabern and in the semi-finals of the UK Open by Gary Mawson, after having defeated rival Taylor by 10 legs to 9 a round earlier. He was also defeated in the quarter finals of the World Matchplay by Wayne Mardle, despite leading 12 legs to 7 at one stage. However, Van Barneveld did regain some form in the World Grand Prix reaching the final of the tournament, before being defeated by Taylor by 6 sets to 2. He then lost to Lewis in the quarter-finals of the inaugural European Darts Championship in November losing by 9 legs to 2.\n\nParagraph 23: Wenceslaus, Wenceslas, Wenzeslaus and Wenzslaus (and other similar names) are Latinized forms of the Czech name Václav. The other language versions of the name are , , , , ,  among others. It is an archaic Polish male given name descending from the Polish word Węzel/Wenzel, Latinised as Wenceslaus spelling for Czech rulers called Vaclav.  It is a very old Lechitic word and name also used in other West Slavic languages such as CzechSlavic dithematic name (of two lexemes), derived from the Slavic words veli/vyache/więce/više (\"great(er), large(r)\"), and slava (\"glory, fame\"), both very common in Slavic names. It roughly means \"greater glory\". Latinised name Wenceslaus corresponds to several West Slavic, Lechitic given names, such as Wieceslaw, Wiecejslav, Wieńczysław/Vienceslav, Vjenceslav, Wenzel, Węzel, Wacław/Vaclav and a few more. \n\nParagraph 24: Born in Zbarazh, Galicia, he moved to Romania in 1845. According to Sol Liptzin, this move was occasioned by the offense his townspeople took at his \"heresies and scoffing verses\".  He worked briefly as a schoolteacher in Botoşani, but soon became an itinerant singer, singing in the homes of wealthy Jews and in workers' cafes in Botoşani, Iaşi, Galaţi, and Piatra Neamț, always glad to sing for a glass of wine or a meal.  An actor as much as a singer, he variously sang the praises of his own footloose life and made up topical songs about whatever might be going on in the towns he passed through; the latter often described injustices, or made fun of the Hasidic Jews, and occasionally got him tossed out of various towns.\n\nParagraph 25: The team was promoted to Serie A, the Italian top flight, for the first time in its history in 2016. In the 2016–17 season, the club finished 17th, securing a place in the next Serie A season. This was despite the Calabrian side only winning two points from the first ten matches, one of the poorest starts the Italian top-flight had seen in years. Crotone remained in the relegation positions for almost the entire season before an impressive revival saw the club achieve a seven-match unbeaten run from matchdays 30 to 36, including five wins in that time, and the season was concluded with a 3-1 victory over Lazio on the last matchday, a result that saw Crotone jump above Empoli to 17th place and thus secured another season in Serie A in what was hailed as a football miracle, led by 13-goal top scorer Diego Falcinelli and coach Davide Nicola. \n\nParagraph 26: The Russian concept of legal state adopted many elements of constitutional economics. Constitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism that describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy, including the budget process. The term \"constitutional economics\" was used by American economist James M. Buchanan as a name for a new academic sub-discipline that in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his \"development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.\" According to Buchanan, the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and \"may be called the idealized Kantian world\" where the individual \"who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behaviour\". Buchanan rejects \"any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members.\" He believes that a constitution, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the state and society against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness. The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual budget planning, as well as the latter's transparency to the civil society, are of primary importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Moreover, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society. Some Russian researchers support an idea that, in the 21st century, the concept of the legal state has become not only a legal but also an economic concept, at least for Russia and many other transitional and developing countries.\n\nParagraph 27: \"William Stark was born in 1724 in a small house on Stark Road in Derry.  In the 1750s, William moved to Starktown – now Dunbarton, N.H. — where his house was used as the meeting house for the next 17 years. On the frontier, the Stark brothers soon gained a reputation as skilled hunters and trappers who ranged all over New Hampshire and Quebec. While hunting in 1754, they were ambush by Indians. William managed to escape but his brother was taken prisoner. John was taken to Montreal where he was eventually ransomed for $103 – the price of a pony. During the French and Indian War, William Stark was part of Rogers' Rangers – colonial America’s greatest fighting force. William Stark was appointed captain and was second in command to the legendary Robert Rogers himself. During the next few years, he fought with bravery in many battles from Fortress Louisbourg in Cape Breton to Fort Ticonderoga in New York. William frequently traveled with his dog Beau de Bien, who drew full soldiers pay because of services as a scout and guard. William was assigned to go with Gen. James Wolfe to attack the French-held city of Quebec. The general could find no way to attack the French army, which was secure on top of the impenetrable cliffs looming high above the St. Lawrence River. One historian purports that it was Major William Stark who told Wolfe of the hidden path to the top of the cliff. The English went on to win the battle but Gen. Wolfe was critically wounded. Stark was one of the four officers who were assigned to carry Wolfe away from the fighting. In Benjamin West’s famous painting, \"The Death of General Wolfe\", it is believed that it's William Stark cradling the dying general in a pose reminiscent of Christ in Michelangelo's \"Pieta\". This battle resulted in England taking control of all of Canada. It is considered one of the most important battles in world history.  After Quebec, William returned to his farm high on a ridge in Dunbarton. Here for the next 16 years, the soldier was at peace; here he and his wife raised seven children and took part in small-town politics. During the morning of 17 April 1775, he was startled to hear the distant sounds of cannon fire coming from 70 miles away at Bunker Hill outside of Boston. Immediately, he grabbed his musket, jumped on his horse and rode toward the fighting. By the time he arrived, the battle was over and he joined his brother John in Medford. William Stark was solidly on the patriot side and soon applied for command of an army to protect the northern border and capture the city of Quebec. Because of his experiences in the French and Indian War there was no one who more qualified for that position then Stark. The New Hampshire government saw fit however to award the command to a politically connected soldier who had formerly been one of Stark's lieutenants. This act of disrespect and idiocy infuriated William Stark. He rode to the British line and became a colonel in the king's army. This action was very upsetting to his brother, patriot Gen. John Stark. When hearing about his brother leaving the state, John Stark said that leaving was \"the best thing he ever did!”  During the war William Stark served in the defense of New York City. The government of New Hampshire confiscated all of his property consisting of thousands of acres of farm and forest land.\"\n\nParagraph 28: The Polish Armed Forces (, German: Polnische Wehrmacht) was a military formation created during World War I. It was created from the more Polish dominated, Polish Auxiliary Crops (also called Polish Legions), headed by Pilsudski. It was the armed forces of a puppet Kingdom of Poland envisioned by the Prussian Mitteleuropa Plan. The results of the recruiting campaign were dismal. The German Polska Siła Zbrojna was nevertheless established, as part of the German Army and under complete German command. The commander-in-chief of the Polska Siła Zbrojna became general-governor Hans Hartwig von Beseler, while the de facto commander was General der Infanterie Felix von Barth, head of the training branch.\n\nParagraph 29: Hanson began her career as a recording artist in 2002 with the release of her debut single “Beautiful Goodbye”, followed by her self-titled debut album being released on Capitol Records in 2003. She co-produced the album with recording engineer Greg Droman and co-wrote most of the songs on it. The album produced three hit singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, including the Top 20 hit \"Beautiful Goodbye\", followed by \"This Far Gone\" at number 42 and \"Half a Heart Tattoo\" at number 40. She made her national TV debut on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on February 28, 2003. In 2007 she switched to Universal South Records, releasing her second studio album Thankful in early 2008, which she co-produced with GRAMMY award-winning mixer and producer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist, Nick Brophy. It produced the singles \"Joyride\" and \"'73\", the former of which also reached number 42 on the country charts. In 2017 Hanson released a 5-song Christmas EP Under The Tree, her first release in almost 10 years since her 2008 album, Thankful. In July 2020 Hanson released a collaboration EP Here's To Hoping with Folk/Americana artist Michael Logen, co-producing and co-writing all 5 tracks. Rolling Stone listed it among its music picks of the week.\n\nParagraph 30: The ligand GABA is the endogenous compound that causes this receptor to open; once bound to GABA, the protein receptor changes conformation within the membrane, opening the pore in order to allow chloride anions (Cl−) and, to a lesser extent, bicarbonate ions (HCO3−) to pass down their electrochemical gradient. The binding site to GABA is about 80Å away from the narrowest part of the ion channel. Recent computational studies have suggested an allosteric mechanism whereby GABA binding leads to ion channel opening. Because the reversal potential for chloride in most mature neurons is close to or more negative than the resting membrane potential, activation of GABAA receptors tends to stabilize or hyperpolarise the resting potential, and can make it more difficult for excitatory neurotransmitters to depolarize the neuron and generate an action potential. The net effect therefore typically inhibitory, reducing the activity of the neuron, although depolarizing currents have been observed in response to GABA in immature neurons in early development. This effect during development is due to a modified Cl− gradient wherein the anions leave the cells through the GABAA receptors, since their intracellular chlorine concentration is higher than the extracellular. The difference in extracellular chlorine anion concentration is presumed to be due to the higher activity of chloride transporters, such as NKCC1, transporting chloride into cells which are present early in development, whereas, for instance, KCC2 transports chloride out cells and is the dominant factor in establishing the chloride gradient later in development. These depolarization events have shown to be key in neuronal development. In the mature neuron, the GABAA channel opens quickly and thus contributes to the early part of the inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP).\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nIn 2008, Van Barneveld, a professional darts player, experienced a lack of success in the PDC. He failed to win any major tournaments and his defense of the World Championship was hindered by flu. While he won his first two matches, he struggled with breathing problems in the second round and was eventually eliminated by Kevin Painter in the third round. Van Barneveld also reached the semi-finals of the 2008 Premier League Darts but was eliminated by James Wade. He suffered early defeats in the US Open and the Las Vegas Desert Classic, and was defeated in the semi-finals of the UK Open by Gary Mawson. Despite leading at one stage, he was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the World Matchplay by Wayne Mardle. However, Van Barneveld did make it to the final of the World Grand Prix before losing to Taylor.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: Touring Park Glienicke by coach was done on the Drive, the main park road, which began at the Middle Gate, nowadays an inconspicuous flight of stairs at the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee(Königstraße). When the chaussee was expanded to become Reichsstraße 1 the street level was raised at the park. Middle Gate was not anymore at the level of the Big Meadows requiring a flight of stairs. To access the “Volkspark” a monumental limestone flight of stairs was probably built in 1935 which was replaced by a more modest construction after 1945. In the 19th century visitors drove through Middle Gate, then past the big erratic with the date 1 May 1824(date of purchase of estate by Prince Charles) and along Big Meadows where the Palace Pond and the Workers’ Quarters were on sight to finally reach the open part of the Garden Courtyard where they entered the Palace. From the Palace the Drive, allowing a view of Coach House Courtyard, went north along Shore Ridge with the Tent as highest vantage point. Close to Hunter's Court after a rather sharp bend the park road went south to the Big Meadows during the first years. Only at the end of the 1830s the completion of the three “gorges” with the pertinent bridges on Shore Ridge and buildings like the Court Gardener's House with the adjacent water tower of the pumping station increased significantly the number of sights inside the park along the sightlines from the Drive. With the park extensions after 1840 the Drive was also extended to include the new parts in the north and the east. Several times the curve in the north was redesigned to a larger radius enabling a new route in the north which offered e.g. a splendid view of Peacock Island from the Drive. In its design the main park road became more dramatic in the east. From a dam leading southeastward views were possible into “gorges” adorned with erratics. Passing the Hermitage the Drive descended into the wooded parts from where in a big westward curve it ascended to the edge of a steep slope which was impressive regarding the usual regional topography. From vantage points there magnificent long-distance views on the Potsdam cultural ensemble were possible.  At the Upper Gate the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee was crossed and the tour continued into Böttcherberg-Park. Following another steep ascent the Alexandra Bench offered a view into the gorge there. At the Rondell the tour would usually be continued to the adjacent Babelsberg Park. On a shorter tour the coach would drive from the Rondell via the Middle Gate back to the Palace.\n\nParagraph 2: Stanley Albert Wolpert was born on December 23, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York to Russian Jewish parents. While serving as an engineer aboard a U.S. Merchant Marine ship, he arrived in Bombay, India for the first time on February 12, 1948. Upon arriving, he was both fascinated and overwhelmed by the extraordinary outpouring of grief over the death of Mahatma Gandhi—whom he then knew very little about—just two weeks earlier. Atop a hill, he witnessed numerous mourning Indians who were rushing to touch the ashes of Gandhi as the ship on which the urn was placed weighed anchor to scatter a portion of his ashes into the water below. On returning home, he abandoned his career in marine engineering for the study of Indian history. He received a B.A. from City College in 1953, and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955 and 1959. with a dissertation (published as Tilak and Gokhale) on the revolutionary and reform wings of the Indian National Congress. The dissertation was one of the two books selected for the now discontinued biennial Watumull Prize of the American Historical Association in 1962, a prize recognizing \"the best book on the history of India originally published in the United States.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Continuing the winning tradition in Chico, the Outlaws made the playoffs the first year but lost in the early rounds. In 2006 they were on the verge of winning the second half that would have put them in the Championship Series versus the Fullerton Flyers, but in an epic collapse they lost a 6 game lead with 10 games to play as they were beaten in 7 of their last 8 games by the Reno Silver Sox.  The Silver Sox went on to win the 2006 GBL Championship defeating the Flyers 3 games to 1. It would take three years, but the Outlaws made it to their first GBL Championship Series in 2007 and beat the Long Beach Armada in four games, 3-1, to bring Chico their first professional championship since 2002.  After winning the championship, Parent stepped down as manager and handed the reins over to former Heat player and Outlaws coach Jon Macalutas.  The Outlaws lead the average attendance in the league with over 2,000 fans in 2008.  On November 12, 2008, Macalutas realized that the job was not a good fit for him and resigned as manager of the Outlaws after his team went 34-51. In 2009, the Outlaws named former major league pitcher Greg Cadaret their manager but he failed to last the season and was fired midway through for his inability to be successful with his players on and off the field.  Hitting coach Kory DeHaan took over and the team responded well with a much better record under DeHaan and improved 10 games over their dismal 2008 season.  DeHaan was asked to return in 2010, but the San Diego Padres took note of his managing success in Chico and offered him a coaching job in their organization in his hometown of Phoenix.\n\nParagraph 4: Riady's entry into the American business community began in 1977, when he was persuaded by Arkansas banking moguls W. R. Witt and Jackson T. Stephens, and founders of Stephens Inc., one of America's largest investment banks outside of Wall Street, to become partners in the Stephens's Worthen Banking Corporation, after the younger Riady was sent by his father, Mochtar Riady, to set up a banking presence in the United States.  Mochtar Riady was also interested in helping Jimmy Carter's former budget director, Bert Lance, sell stock he held in the National Bank of Georgia, though the deal never materialized.  Through their dealings with Stephens Inc. the Riadys made the acquaintance of the then-Arkansas governor, Bill Clinton. In the early 1980s James and his father signed a licensing agreement with Zenith Electronics to produce color television sets in Indonesia and built a large production plant near Jakarta. Later, in 1985, Worthen was indicted of having administered several million dollars' worth of illegal, preferential loans to companies owned by the Riadys. The loans had allegedly been channeled through Lippo Finance and Investment, the Riadys' Little Rock-based company established in 1983, as well as the Stephenses and Liem Swie Liong, another Chinese-Indonesian businessman, sometimes described as having been Mochtar's mentor.\n\nParagraph 5: In 2021 the Unicorns met the Tirol Raiders again. Since the BIG6 didn't exist anymore the two teams participated in the Central European Football League the new European top tournament and both teams made it to the bowl game. This time, the Unicorns managed to beat the Raiders and won their first European title. In the GFL, the team posted their fifth straight perfect regular season with a 10–0 record (the 2020 German Football League was not played due to Covid) in a season with a reduced schedule of only ten games instead of the usual 14. Beating their German Bowl rival Braunschweig in the quarterfinal in a game that opened in a sack by the Unicorns defense and saw an interception carried to a pick six in the opening drive by Italian-American Unicorns defender Cody Pastorino Hall defeated Braunschweig by 38–13 taking five turnovers from the Lions. The semifinal against the Potsdam Royals proved closer at 28–18 but its main importance was in the injuries to key players the Unicorns suffered - starting Quarterback Alexander Haupert (also the Quarterback of the Germany national American football team) was out with a knee injury and questionable for the final while starting running back John Santiago tore his ACL and was out for the rest of the season. In German Bowl XLII Hall would face another \"familiar face\" in their semifinal opponents from the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019 seasons, the Dresden Monarchs. Haupert, playing despite his injury, was knocked out of the game with a broken clavicle early in the second quarter, requiring Reilly Hennessey, who had just led  Parma Panthers to an Italian Bowl win that July, to step in under center in his first ever game in the German Football League. While the Unicorns led at the half 12–7 and once again had the turnover differential in their favor 2–1 their score early in the third quarter to make it 19–7 should prove their last and in the end Dresden won 28–19 with Hall failing to convert on a Field Goal attempt late in the game. Dresden thus celebrated their first playoff victory over the Unicorns since 2010, the first Championship for a team from the New States of Germany and dealt Hall their fifth German Bowl defeat in nine appearances and the first one not at the hands of Braunschweig. The Head Coach who led Dresden to their victory, Ulrich \"Ulz\" Däuber, was a Unicorns alumn himself, having played for them in the eighties and nineties and having been a coach in their youth system in the 1990s before an extended stint in the US.\n\nParagraph 6: The Stroop task, or modified Stroop task, displays different types of words (e.g., threatening and neutral) in varying colors. The participant is then asked to identify the color of the word while ignoring the actual semantic content. Increased response time to indicate the color of threat words relative to neutral words suggests an attentional bias toward such threat. The Stroop task, however, has some interpretational difficulties in addition to the lack of allowance for the measurement of spatial attention allocation. To address some of the limitations of the Stroop task, the dot probe task displays two words or pictures on a computer screen (either one at the top or left and the other on the bottom or right, respectively) and after a brief stimuli presentation, often less than 1000ms, a probe appears in the location of one of the two stimuli and participants are asked to press a button indicating the location of the probe. Different response times between target (e.g., threat) and neutral stimuli infer attentional biases to the target information with shorter response times for when the probe is in the place of the target stimuli indicating an attention bias for that type of information. In another task that examines spatial attentional allocation, the visual search task asks participants to detect a target stimulus embedded in a matrix of distractors (e.g., an angry face among several neutral or other emotional faces or vice versa). Faster detection times to find emotional stimuli among neutral stimuli or slower detection times to find neutral stimuli among emotional distractors infer an attentional bias for such stimuli. The spatial cuing task asks participants to focus on a point located between two rectangles at which point a cue is presented, either in the form of one of the rectangles lighting up or some emotional stimuli appearing within one of the rectangles and this cue either directs attention toward or away from the actual location of the target stimuli. Participants then press a button indicating the location of the target stimuli with faster response times indicating an attention bias toward such stimuli.  In the morph task participants gradually scroll a facial photograph from the neutral expression to an emotion or from one emotion to another  and should indicate at what frame each emotion appears on the face. A recently introduced method consists of presenting dynamic faces (videoclips) and measuring verbal reaction time (into a microphone); it is more precise than previous solutions: verbal responses to six basic emotions differ in hit rates and reaction times.\n\nParagraph 7: In adapting the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing the names of the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to \"a small New Mexico town.\" Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that \"would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely ... we need that childlike innocence.\" He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so \"we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story.\" The filmmakers have noted that \"they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context\", while at the same time paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that \"the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book.\" Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating \"There are things that [Lindqvist] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it.\" In adapting the story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's \"evil empire speech\" as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, \"The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets\". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he \"would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [Reagan era] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that.\"\n\nParagraph 8: The most valuable remains that we possess are the commentaries on the Metaphysics of Aristotle. In explaining the propositions of Aristotle, he appends the views held by the Neoplatonist school on the subject in hand, and endeavours to establish the latter against the former. In his Metaphysics commentary Syrianus explains his view of the Monad and the Dyad in a number of places. The One is immediately followed by a supreme monad and dyad. Syrianus describes the monad as masculine and the dyad as feminine. He employs the doctrine of the two cosmic principles to explain the origin of evil. He denies that there are Platonic forms of things which are evil or base. The dyad is indirectly responsible for evil. Syrianus attributes the existence of evil to otherness and plurality, which he believes the dyad is directly responsible for creating.\n\nParagraph 9: The West Loop lies along the western bank of the Chicago River. It generally includes the districts of Fulton River, Fulton Market, and Greektown.  It is approximately bounded by Grand Avenue on the north, Ashland Avenue on the west, the Eisenhower Expressway on the south, and the Chicago River on the east. Popular restaurants line Randolph Street, including Girl and the Goat by Stephanie Izard, and Leña Brava, founded by Rick Bayless who has since departed the establishment.  The area has experienced rapid gentrification. A former manufacturing and warehousing area, many of the buildings have been converted to loft condominiums, restaurants, bars, and art galleries. Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios were located on Randolph Street; the site is now the recently constructed corporate headquarters of McDonald's. Soho House was one of the first boutique hotels in West Loop, and Ace Hotels followed in 2017. Retailers in West Loop include Maria Pinto, Billy Reid, Free People, and Madewell.\n\nParagraph 10: Born in Chicago, Illinois, he started out playing music at a very early age. Having been schooled by the likes of Oscar Brown Jr., Donny Hathaway, Baby Huey and later on Curtis Mayfield, he honed his writing and singing skills and began his career, first in a band called Lyfe (which also included Chaka Khan). Khan then left and joined Rufus (scoring several pop and R&B hits with them). Christopher later joined another band called High Voltage with future Rufus members Bobby Watson (bassist) and Tony Maiden, as well as Lalomie Washburn, who later wrote several Rufus songs. Christopher himself would also become associated with Rufus, as he penned the song \"Once You Get Started\", which was later recorded by the band and hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975. He also wrote three songs on Rufus' next album, Rufus featuring Chaka Khan: \"Dance Wit Me\" (another big hit), \"Fool's Paradise,\" and \"Have A Good Time.\"\n\nParagraph 11: At the start of the 6th century Caredigion is ruled by king Gwythno Garanhir, and his subordinate Prince Seithenyn ap Seithyn is in charge of the embankments that protect the plain of Gwaelod in Caredigion from the sea.  One of Seithenyn's officials, Teithrin ap Tathral, discovers that the embankment is in a poor state of repair, and tells Elphin, son of king Gwythno.  Together they find Seithenyn, who is as usual drunk, and warn him of the dangerous state of the sea-defences, but he dismisses their fears with specious arguments.  Elphin then meets Angharad, Seithenyn's beautiful daughter, and together they watch the onset of a mighty tempest, which destroys the embankment so that the sea breaks through.  Seithenyn, with drunken bravado, leaps into the waves, sword in hand, but Teithrin, Elphin and Angharad make their escape to king Gwythno's castle.  Gwythno is distraught at the submersion of the best part of his kingdom under Cardigan Bay.  Elphin marries Angharad and settles down to earn his living from the produce of a salmon-weir he has constructed.  One day he finds in this weir a coracle containing a baby, whom he names Taliesin and raises along with his own daughter, Melanghel.  As Taliesin grows up he learns the precepts of Druidism and becomes a bard.  Gwythno dies, and Elphin inherits the throne of the reduced and impoverished kingdom of Caredigion, but is soon abducted by Maelgon, king of Gwyneth.  Maelgon's son, Rhun, visits Elphin's home and seduces a woman whom he believes to be Angharad, but who is actually her servant.  Taliesin sets out to free Elphin at the prompting of his foster-sister, Melanghel, with whom he is in love.  At Maelgon's court he announces himself as a bard of Elphin, vindicates Angharad's honour, and enters into a poetic contest with Maelgon's bards, in the course of which he warns him of various impending dooms, including an attack by King Arthur and death by plague.  Taliesin returns to Caredigion.  Rhun follows him, wanting to make a second attempt on Angharad, but he is lured into a cave and there imprisoned when a boulder is released to seal up the entrance.  Taliesin sets out to find King Arthur in Caer Lleon.  On his way there he stops at Dinas Vawr, a fortress just captured by king Melvas, whose men are celebrating their victory in wine and song; among them he is astounded to find Angharad's father, Seithenyn ap Seithyn, who it turns out survived the flooding of Gwaelod so many years before.  Taliesin reaches Caer Lleon, admires its splendours, then gets audience of King Arthur, who is keeping Christmas merrily, even though his wife Gwenyvar has been abducted by person or persons unknown.  He tells the king a secret he has learned from Seithenyn, that Gwenyvar is being held by Melvas; then he moves on to Avallon, where Gwenyvar is being kept captive, in the hope of negotiating her peaceful release.  There he meets Seithenyn again, together with the abbot of Avallon, both of whom agree to help him.  Together these three convince Melvas that he has more to gain by voluntarily releasing Gwenyvar to Arthur than by facing Arthur's wrath.  Back in Caer Lleon Taliesin takes part in another bardic contest.  Llywarch sings his \"The Brilliancies of Winter\", Merlin his \"Apple Trees\" and Aneirin his \"The Massacre of the Britons\", but Taliesin's contribution, a portion of the Hanes Taliesin, is declared the finest.  Seithenyn and the abbot then make their entrance, bringing Gwenyvar with them, and having restored her to Arthur they tell him that Taliesin was instrumental in securing her release.  The grateful king grants Taliesin a boon, and Taliesin begs that Arthur will command Maelgon to release Elphin.  Maelgon himself makes his appearance at this point and unwillingly submits to Arthur's will.  Arthur sends an emissary to fetch Elphin, Rhun, and all other concerned parties, including Melanghel.  The story ends with Taliesin's marriage to Melanghel, and election as Chief of the Bards of Britain.\n\nParagraph 12: Within a short period from fifteen million tons of mined minerals in 1871, the year in which the discovery of the Mine of Monte Narba was declared, 2000 average tons a year were achieved and produced within the ten years between 1880 and 1890, that Rolandi defined as \"silvery ten-year-span-of-time\", in which productions reached the value of two millions lire.  From the three mines that were constituted on the ore body in 1871, they increased to ten within twenty years to decrease later in order to become only one when it came to close it for good.  In Sarrabus it came to a real quest for silver: together with big societies, such as the Society of Lanusei and the society of Monteponi, many extemporised diggers of valuable metals demanded hundreds of permits to carry out mineral searches on the territories of the towns of Muravera, Villaputzu and, particularly, of San Vito. In 1851 the Genuese company \"Unione Sulcis e Sarrabus\" acquired the research permits in the area of Monte Narba, in the comune of San Vito.  In 1885 the French engineer Leon Goüin founded in Genua the \"Società Tacconis-Sarrabus\" for the exploitation of the Tacconis mine. In 1888 Goüin himself constituted in Paris the \"Societé des mines de Rio Ollastu\". In its most flourishing period the ore body of the Sarrabus employed up to 1500 workers, distributed among the mines of Masaloni, Giovanni Bonu, Monte Narba, Per'Arba, Baccu Arrodas, Tuviois, S'erra e S'Ilixi and Nicola Secci. Just to have a more precise idea of the quality value of the silver ore body of the Sarrabus we can say that, while in the rest of the world the average silver revenue for 100 kilograms of lead was swaying around 200/300 grams, in the body of the Sarrabus was achieved an average of 1 kilogram for 100 kilograms.  In Baccu Arrodas the assays were much higher.\n\nParagraph 13: Modern reviews are very positive. Greg Prato of AllMusic reminds how the band moved to the UK, which was having a \"heavy metal resurgence (dubbed the New Wave of British Heavy Metal)\", to record with UFO bassist Pete Way \"many of the band's best compositions from their club days\" and finds Under the Blade \"one of Twisted Sister's hardest rocking albums... highly recommended to lovers of early-'80s British heavy metal.\" Also Exclaim! reviewer Ian Gormely considers the album \"a must for anyone with an interest in the history of American hard rock\". Despite \"the raw production... and lack of an obvious hit... it laid the groundwork for their future success\", thanks also to Twisted Sister's \"tongue-in-cheek presentation that latter-day hair metal bands clearly lacked.\" Adrian Begrand of PopMatters reviews the album as a \"near-classic\" and \"the most ferocious of the band's career.\" He writes that the musicians may have \"bar band roots\", but on the album \"the fun side of Twisted Sister is set aside in favor of something a lot darker\", which brought to \"a hell of a debut that not only connected with British heavy metal fans, but would eventually lead to a contract with Atlantic Records, paving the way to stardom a couple years later.\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considers Under the Blade \"dead serious despite the garish imagery, a good four-fifths of it rocking with hellacious clout, attitude and clever economy\" and remarks how the influence of Judas Priest is evident in Dee Snider's compositions.\n\nParagraph 14: Located on Little Trodgers Lane, on a 400 ft. hill midway between the valley of the River Rother and the village of Mark Cross, ground was broken for the original orphanage in 1864. The area was originally known as De Hellingly, comprising Colkins and Pennybridge Farms . It cost £20,000 to build and took four years to complete. Many of the Canterbury red clay bricks were dug from the 109-acre plot at sites which later became a rifle range to the south-east and a pond to the south. They were fired in situ and transported 200 yards to the building area. Most of the external masonry was made from local sandstone also quarried nearby.  The main wall was built 3 ft 3ins in thickness (approx. 1 meter) and the internal masonry was in Caen stone. The passages, original play rooms and offices were in finished brickwork. The basement is vaulted and the floor of the first story laid with Mintons patent tiles. Above the ground floor the walls are recessed and arched, the piers of which are further relieved by corbelled brickwork. A gothic-style chapel accommodating 150 was added to the east and to the north a playground was laid. On the far north side of the playground a series of buildings were added at right angles, intended for a laundry, bake-house and workshops. The contractor was a Mr Wilson of Canterbury. In front of the school to the south lay extensive fields, meadows and woods. In the early years the school was self-sufficient with its own chicken run, most of the fields were cultivated or used for grazing and on the opposite hill was Pennybridge Farm, owned by the school and managed by the Brothers who employed labourers to run it. Milk and orchard produce were of sufficient quantity for the school to be a major trading partner with Mayfield Village and its Convent. Later cultivation ceased in the field immediately in front of the school where football (later cricket and rugby) pitches were laid out. A cultivated plot with lawns and a cemetery to one side were also installed. Until 1913 Pugin's vision stood untouched as a distinguished edifice visible from many miles around, faithful to his plans, but owing to faulty foundations the building had to be underpinned at this time. The tower's spire, a large chimney block and other heavy adornments were removed and its external beauty was sacrificed for practical safety. It was almost a century before the spire was replaced and the building's majesty restored.\n\nParagraph 15: In the season premiere, \"Seed\", eight months pass and Carol has built self-confidence and has developed a proficiency with weapons. Carol has gotten closer to Lori since her pregnancy, and her trust in Rick has been regained. In the episode \"Killer Within\", T-Dog sacrifices himself to save Carol after they are separated when walkers get into the prison. The group believe her to be dead. In the episode \"Hounded\", Daryl rediscovers her in a solitary confinement cell, malnourished and weak but alive. He carries her off in his arms and in the next episode, \"When the Dead Come Knocking\", the group happily reunites with her; however, things once again take a sad turn when she realizes that Lori has died in childbirth. She and Rick tearfully mourn Lori's loss and Carol is seen taking care of Lori's child, Judith, while Daryl leaves for Woodbury. As Daryl tells Carol to keep safe, she responds saying, \"Nine lives, remember?\". In the episode \"The Suicide King\", Carol is sad about Daryl leaving with his brother but understands his decision. In the episode \"Home\", Axel is shot in front of Carol's face by The Governor's men as they bond, causing her to use his body as a shield. In the episode \"I Ain't a Judas\", Daryl returns, pleasing Carol. Andrea also visits, and Carol instructs Andrea to stab The Governor in his sleep to end the conflict. In the episode \"This Sorrowful Life\", Merle has a brief conversation with Carol wherein he remarks that she has transformed from a \"scared little mouse afraid of her own shadow\" into a stronger person. She replies that she was not scared of her own shadow but that of her husband and further states that she is no longer afraid of anything. To prove the latter, she sternly admonishes Merle to \"pick a side,\" regarding his previous loyalty to The Governor. In the season finale \"Welcome to the Tombs\", following Merle's death at the hands of The Governor, Carol praises him for his sacrifice, that he gave them a chance though Daryl remarked that Merle had never performed an altruistic deed in his life. Carol then helps defend the gate against walkers as Rick, Daryl, and Michonne drive out to carry the fight to Woodbury. She is seen beginning to cry upon realizing that Andrea has died at the end of the episode, and watches the remaining Woodbury residents enter their new home in the prison.\n\nParagraph 16: In the summer of 1918, the Board of Trustees of Rutgers College voted to establish a college for women that would be encompassed by the larger Rutgers University. Since the university’s original chartering in 1766 as Queen’s College, it had been committed to give the young adults of the state of New Jersey access to higher education. At the turn of the 20th century, as more and more young men went off to fight in the war, education for women began to be discussed further and was of greater importance. In fact, Mabel Smith Douglass, the first dean of the Women’s College, “along with the New Jersey federation of Women’s Clubs, led the movement, which began in earnest in 1911, to establish the institution.\" At this same meeting where the Board of Trustees voted to establish this college, a special committee was appointed to oversee the planning and management, to basically oversee the fruition of this decision. Locations for the college we are discussed in length as well as how much it would take to establish the college and who would run it. According to the recorded minutes, “The Board of Trustees has decided to take over the estate of Mrs. John N. Carpender, New Brunswick, near the college property” and Mrs. Douglass was to be appointed the Dean of the Women’s College. The estimated cost for the establishment of the college was $75,000. In addition to this, the board also hoped that the college could be established quickly enough to open that coming September. In the address given by university President, William Henry Demarest, in reference to the board’s meetings, he states, “An item of utmost importance is the coming into the market of the John N. Carpender property, near the college farm, 9 acres and a very large stone house [College Hall], which in the judgement of all consulted would be a best possible location and building for a start of the enterprise.” He later goes onto mention how the asking price for said property is $60,000, and himself and the board do not know how to finance their purchase. This leads to various meetings that would result in different campaigns to fund the purchase of the estate and the founding of the college. For each of these campaigns, more money was collected from private donors as well as the state so that the property could be rented out the college for the first few years of operation. However, the location of the college was not secure until a donation of $50,000 from Mr. James Neilson was made for the purchase of the College Hall Property in 1921.\n\nParagraph 17: Rick Swan reviewed From the Ashes for Dragon magazine #198 (October 1993). He calls From the Ashes \"ambitious\", and notes that \"By combining heroic tradition with elements of dark fantasy, [Carl Sargent has] come up with a Greyhawk campaign that is both familiar and refreshingly unexpected. Nearly as nasty as the Dark Sun setting, the new, grimmer Greyhawk world is made to order for players who found the original version too flabby to be much fun.\" He noted that this \"lavish package\" has \"a lot of material to digest, but thankfully, the quality of the writing makes it go down easy. Sargent not only has a vivid imagination, but a strong command of the English language, a rare combination in an industry where publishers tend to value typing speed more than muscular prose. Despite the occasional creaky sentence [...] it’s a pleasure to read.\" While he notes that the \"Thoughtful sidebars and helpful summaries enhance the set’s reference value\", he complains that \"despite the tight editing and logical organization, it’s not always easy to find specific entries; a subject index or an expanded table of contents would’ve helped\". He also comments about the art and graphics: \"To its detriment, the set emphasizes text over graphics, with few appealing visuals other than the color maps. Most of the illustrations depict generic fantasy scenes and have nothing much to do with the text they accompany. Those wanting maps of local neighborhoods or floor plans of important buildings will have to draw their own. The rune and glyph display, lifted virtually verbatim from the original World of Greyhawk boxed set, does little more than fill up a page.\" However, he compliments the poster maps, calling them \"terrific, rendered in rich hues and clear notations. Thanks to the grid coordinates printed along the borders, it's easy to find desired locations [...] The grid system is nearly as user-friendly as individually numbered hexes and makes for less clutter.\" In \"Book One, Atlas of the Flanaess\", Swan complains that things \"get off to a sluggish start\" with the lengthy historical summary, noting that it is apparently necessary \"to provide context and bring newcomers up to date. But it's also complicated and turgid, sort of like a lecture from a professor who left his sense of humor in his other suit.\" He felt that the cyclopedia entries \"pick up the pace a bit. Nevertheless, the casual reader may feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. [...] While much of this is interesting [...] Sargent doesn’t have the space he needs to do justice to an entire world. When you only have a few paragraphs to spend on a country, it’s tough to give more than a superficial overview.\" He felt that in \"Book Two, the Campaign Book\", Sargent \"shifts into high gear as he narrows his focus on the areas in and around the Free City of Greyhawk. It’s a virtuoso performance, with a flawless mix of exposition, atmosphere, and detail. Sargent sets the stage in the opening pages by painting a bleak picture of a struggling populace. [...] Uncertainty prevails, and player characters will find plenty to keep them on their toes.\" Swan notes that the set's fantasy elements \"stick pretty close to AD&D conventions, bad news for old-timers who’ve had their fill of sinister monsters, enchanted dungeons, and meddlesome deities. But Sargent's limber imagination enlivens even the weariest cliches. [...] Sargent has loaded the books with nifty details [...] making a trip through the text as fun as an Easter egg hunt.\" He calls the offered scenario hooks \"a mixed bag\", noting that on the adventure springboards \"with only a few paragraphs per entry, there's not much to work with\" and that the two adventure outlines in the \"Campaign Book\" are not particularly satisfying, as \"Into the Mistmarsh\" involves a \"garden-variety hunt\" and \"The Sin Eater\" relies too heavily on die-rolls and \"climaxes with a battle that may prove to be too deadly for all but the strongest or luckiest PCs\". He does note  that the reference-card adventures \"benefit from thoughtful development and clever staging\", with \"Brainstorm\" being \"the best of a dud-free collection\".  Swan concludes his review by saying, \"A few years ago, I was convinced that the Greyhawk setting had reached a creative dead end. Now I’m not so sure. Carl Sargent has done a remarkable job of reshaping the rickety, make-it-up-as-you-go-along campaign of old into an intelligible whole. Flaws aside-the so-so visuals, sluggish Book One, and hit-or-miss adventures —From the Ashes stands as the definitive Greyhawk reference and the most enjoyable Greyhawk product to date.\"\n\nParagraph 18: In the late 1930s many of Starostin's friends and associates were arrested as part of the Great Purge, including Kosarev. There were also attempts to more closely control sporting matters, including forcing the Semi-final of the 1939 cup to be replayed after Spartak won the first match by a disputed goal. They went on to win the replay, which did not take place until after Spartak had already won the final. On March 20, 1942, Starostin was arrested, along with his three brothers and other fellow players, facing accusations of involvement in a plot to kill Joseph Stalin. Following two years of interrogation in the Lubyanka, the charges were dropped but the Starostins were tried and sentenced to ten years in Siberia anyway, having been found guilty of \"lauding bourgeois sport and attempting to drag bourgeois mores into Soviet sport\". The sentence was very lenient in view of the popularity of football and Starostin. When details from the actual court sentence were published in 2003, it turned out Starostins were not convicted for political crimes, but rather for stealing sporting goods from the stores they were supposed to oversee and selling those goods on. Nikolai Starostin profited for 28,000 rubles, Aleksandr for 12,000, Andrei and Pyotr - for 6,000 each. Also, Nikolai Starostin was convicted of bribing the military commisar of the Bauman district of Moscow, Kutarzhevskiy. Kutarzhevskiy, using his power arranged so that several people who were supposed to have been conscripted to serve in the Army during World War II were not sent to the front and stayed in Moscow instead. Those people included food distributors and food store managers, who in turn provided Starostin with unlimited food supply during the war time, when food shortages were common (according to the sentence, food store manager Zvyozdkin gave Starostin 60 kilograms of butter and 50 kilograms of meat products).\n\nParagraph 19: Borgata was part of a major project in Atlantic City nicknamed \"The Tunnel Project\", started around 1999. When Steve Wynn planned the Le Jardin in Atlantic City, he wanted to connect a $330 million  tunnel from the Atlantic City Expressway to the new resort, later named the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, which would funnel incoming traffic off the Atlantic City Expressway into the city's marina district. This caused major controversy, as it would cut through a residential neighborhood; competitor Donald Trump sued Wynn for it saying that it was a \"driveway\" to Wynn's casino. The Tunnel Project did progress, even after Le Jardin was cancelled, and finally opened in 2001.\n\nParagraph 20: It was located at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma at a height of 2200 m above sea level. It was operated by an international collaboration of research institutes and universities, such as the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, the German Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, the University of Wuppertal, the IFKKI in Kiel or the University of Hamburg. It consisted of several detector types for observing secondary particles from particle cascades in the atmosphere. The particle cascades detected by HEGRA were produced by cosmic ray particles in the energy range of 1012eV to 1016eV.\n\nParagraph 21: Driver was a founding member of maudlin of the Well in 1996 along with Jason Byron and Greg Massi. They morphed into Kayo Dot in 2003 during the process of recording what would have been motW's fourth album, and titled Kayo Dot's henceforth first album Choirs of the Eye, due to label problems and the desire to move away from being pigeonholed in the metal scene. In 2009, due to fan requests and contributions, Driver, along with Terran Olson who was also still playing with Kayo Dot, reformed maudlin of the Well to record the digital album Part the Second, reuniting with guitarists Greg Massi, Josh Seipp-Williams, and drummer Sam Gutterman. The album contained five newly released songs, some of which were composed—partially at least—in the early days of the band (as far back as 1997), with lyrics co-written by Jason Byron and Toby Driver. Maudlin of the Well's style was always described by the band as \"astral metal,\" referencing Driver and Byron's interest in astral projection. Driver has stated that he used astral projection and lucid dreaming as methods to retrieve music from the subconscious. Maudlin of the Well's lyrics deal with this topic, as well as the subjects of ghosts and the paranormal, the occult, kabbalah, nostalgia, and betrayal. The liner notes for their companion albums, Bath and Leaving Your Body Map (2001) contain a puzzle that leads to an as-yet-unknown solution.\n\nParagraph 22: Following the allegations, Moore appeared as a guest on Sacha Baron Cohen's 2018 comedy series Who Is America? in which Baron Cohen, disguised as  Israeli anti-terrorism expert Erran Morad, demonstrates new \"technology\", supposedly developed by the Israeli Army to identify pedophiles. Moore walked out of the interview after the device repeatedly indicated he was a pedophile. In September 2018, Moore filed a lawsuit against Baron Cohen, Showtime, and CBS Corporation seeking $95 million in damages for alleged fraud, defamation, and emotional distress. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and argued that the consent agreement signed by Moore was \"obtained through fraud\" and was therefore \"void and inoperative.\" In October 2018, Showtime moved for a change of venue to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Despite the consent agreement specifying that any disputes be dealt with in a New York court, Moore's legal team opposed the change in venue, describing the move as \"purely tactical, as they clearly perceive New York to a more favorable forum, where they will more than likely find a favorable left-leaning, pro-entertainment industry judge.\" Moore's legal team also contended that he had been \"fraudulently induced\" to appear on the show by two primary misrepresentations: Firstly, that Moore was under the impression that he was being flown to Washington D.C. to receive an award for his support of Israel; and, secondly, that he was told that the segment was being produced by an Israeli production company named Yerushalayim TV. In July 2021, Moore's lawsuit was dismissed by Southern District of New York Judge John Cronan, who wrote that \"Moore's claims are barred by the unambiguous contractual language, which precludes the very causes of action he now brings.\" This decision was upheld in July 2022, with the appeals court writing in its unsigned summary order that \"Baron Cohen may have implied (despite his in character disclaimers of any belief that Judge Moore was a pedophile) that he believed Judge Moore's accusers, but he did not imply the existence of any independent factual basis for that belief besides the obviously farcical pedophile detecting 'device,' which no reasonable person could believe to be an actual, functioning piece of technology.\" Responding to the judgement, Moore told the Associated Press that Baron Cohen's \"pusillanimous and fraudulent conduct must be stopped,\" and that he will be making a further appeal.\n\nParagraph 23: On April 8, 2014, after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008, the team fired general manager Mike Gillis. One day later, ownership hired former Canucks captain Trevor Linden as team president, to assist in the search for a new general manager. Three weeks after Linden was hired, the Canucks announced that both head coach John Tortorella and assistant coach Mike Sullivan, who had only just been hired prior to the start of the 2013–14 season, were fired. Throughout the search for Vancouver's new general manager, it was speculated that Linden's preferred candidate was Jim Benning, who was serving as an assistant general manager for the Boston Bruins. On May 21, the Canucks confirmed that Benning had been hired as their new general manager. One of Benning's first changes to the roster was buying out David Booth, who had one year remaining on his contract. As a result of the buyout, Booth became an unrestricted free agent, and he will receive $1,583,333 per year (over the next two seasons) from the Canucks; Booth's buyout salary will not be applied to Vancouver's salary cap. The next major task for the Canucks was finding a new head coach. Among the candidates Benning interviewed were New York Rangers assistant coach Scott Arniel, and former Pittsburgh Penguins coach Dan Bylsma. Additionally, Texas Stars head coach Willie Desjardins was also one the coaches Benning was long rumoured to have interest in. However, Benning was not able to interview Desjardins until late June, as Desjardins had just won the Calder Cup with Texas. On June 23, the Canucks officially introduced Desjardins as the 18th head coach in Canucks history. The next major tasks facing Benning were dealing with the trade request of Ryan Kesler, and preparing for the draft on June 27. On draft day, Benning completed a series of trades before the Canucks even made their first pick. Jason Garrison was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning for a 2nd-round draft pick, and then Ryan Kesler was traded to the Anaheim Ducks for Nick Bonino, Luca Sbisa, the twenty-fourth overall pick, and a 3rd-round draft pick. Benning then flipped Anaheim's 3rd-round pick to the New York Rangers, in exchange for Derek Dorsett. On June 28 (the second day of the draft), Benning acquired Linden Vey from the Los Angeles Kings, in exchange for Tampa Bay's 2nd-round pick (acquired the day before in the Garrison trade). As a result of trading away Roberto Luongo in March, the Canucks were left with a goalie tandem of Eddie Lack and Jacob Markstrom, who together had combined for 88 games of NHL experience. Thus, Benning's first move on July 1 was to sign free-agent goalie Ryan Miller to a 3-year, $18 million contract, in order to bring a veteran presence to Vancouver's goaltending position. Benning's next major transaction occurred only one day after acquiring Miller, as he signed former Phoenix Coyotes winger Radim Vrbata to a 2-year, $10 million contract. On July 3, Benning signed restricted free agent Zack Kassian to a 2-year, $3.5 million deal. On July 5, the Canucks re-signed defenceman Christopher Tanev to a 1-year, $2 million contract, only hours before the deadline to file for salary arbitration. On July 7, Benning named Doug Lidster as an assistant coach for the Canucks; Lidster had also recently served as an assistant coach to new Canucks head coach Willie Desjardins on the Texas Stars.\n\nParagraph 24: Weatherhead's concept of the divinity of Christ was merely that Jesus stood in a special relationship with God and \"indeed an incarnation of God in a fuller sense than any other known Being.\" Despite many texts such as John 1, John 14, Philippians 2, Colossians 1, Titus 3, 2 Peter 1, Revelation 5 etc, Weatherhead claimed that the New Testament never teaches that Jesus is God, nor that Jesus taught this, observing that Jesus preferred to refer to himself the Son of Man. Despite John 1 and John 3, Weatherhead taught that the idea of Jesus being \"the only begotten son\" of God is impossible - and that such information is not presently available. The virgin birth was not an issue for Weatherhead, having (in his view) never been a major tenet for being a follower of Christ. Moreover, he claimed that the New Testament traces Jesus' lineage through his father Joseph, not Mary, to show that he descended from the house of David. Weatherhead claimed that Jesus never said he was sinless. He comments that Jesus sometimes showed anger, especially to false teachers, that he cursed a fig tree because it didn't produce fruit and rebuked Peter, one of his closest disciples, which Weatherhead interprets as Jesus calling Peter Satan. Weatherhead taught that many theologians assumed Jesus' sinlessness because of his moral superiority, but that Jesus never made that claim for himself. Despite the frequent teaching of Old and New Testaments about the need for blood sacrifice, Weatherhead apparently agreed with Nathaniel Mickelm, whom he quoted, that the blood sacrifice of Jesus was unnecessary for forgiveness of sins. For Mickelm (and subsequently for Weatherhead), it was a perversion of God to suppose that \"God did not and could not forgive sins apart from the death of Christ.\" According to Weatherhead, that sacrifice merely revealed something of God's nature that made one want to be forgiven. \n\nParagraph 25: When Loaiza returned, Halsey returned to middle relief duty in mid-June. His statistics through mid-August were 3–3, 4.50 ERA. On August 10, Halsey was optioned to Oakland's Triple-A affiliate in Sacramento when the Athletics activated reliever Jay Witasick from the disabled list only to be recalled on August 22 with the A's needing a fifth starter in a string of consecutive games. He finished the year in middle relief. His statistics for the year were 5–4, 4.67 ERA. Halsey did not make the playoff roster for Oakland's division series against the Minnesota Twins. Oakland already had a left-hander in Joe Kennedy.\n\nParagraph 26: By \"All the Madame's Men\", McCown-Levy felt that Agents of Hydra was \"the most consistently entertaining arc the series has ever done. The show has had higher highs, but never this constant a level of quality. I've argued several times of late that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has been getting steadily better each season, and even in a year that had strong arcs like Ghost Rider and LMD, this final storyline tops them all ... the show has essentially managed to create an alternate reality where it can work out longstanding issues and address unfinished character beats, all while smartly delivering action and thrills ... And insofar as this keeps working, it's managed to turn the TV equivalent of a fun B-movie into a superior television show.\" Overall, Schwartz awarded the season an 8.8 out of 10, stating the season was \"the best [the series has] ever been, maturing as a show and learning the right lessons from what's come before.\" She praised the pod format, saying it \"helped tighten the season and give it a stronger throughline\" and added that each new pod the season introduced was more successful than the previous, with the Agents of Hydra pod and Framework story arc possibly the strongest of the entire series. Schwartz also spoke fondly of the guest stars throughout the season, particularly Jansen, who she called \"the season's MVP\" and felt \"stole the show\" with Aida, who was \"the standout new character\" of the season. Some negatives on the season were the additional villains, Eli Morrow and the Superior (not \"a particularly standout villain\", and never \"as imposing or terrifying as he should have been\", respectively), and some of the early effects work, though she also praised \"the great CGI work\" with Ghost Rider. Den of Geeks Rob Leane also praised the pod format, saying it \"fixed the 22-episode problem\". He felt the Ghost Rider pod had amazing visual effects, and was a \"natural\" length that other series may have stretched further. He also highlighted Wen's performance as LMD May in the LMD pod and the Agents of Hydra pod's Mack and Hope storyline, and praised the guest performances of Luna and Jansen (feeling that bringing the latter two together in the finale \"was the perfect way to wrap things up\"). Leane called the season \"a master class in how Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. can thrive going forward ... the writers keep throwing in more sci-fi concepts, the special effects team keep delivering, and the cast keep stepping up their game to keep up with it all.\"\n\nParagraph 27: On June 19, 1974 George Strawbridge and Beau Rogers, IV purchased an expansion franchise in North American Soccer League for the sum of $25,000 and by July 24 they named Eddie Firmani their coach. In October 1974, Alex Pringle becomes the first player to sign with the team. On November 21, 1974, the Tampa Bay Professional Soccer Club announced that they would henceforth be known as the Tampa Bay Rowdies. The Rowdies played ten seasons at Tampa Stadium and won their only Soccer Bowl championship in their 1975 inaugural season, defeating the Portland Timbers 2–0 on August 24. The Rowdies also finished as runners-up in 1978 and 1979. The team showcased international stars such as midfielder, and team captain Rodney Marsh (England), 1979 league scoring leader Óscar Fabbiani (Chile), swift and forward Steve Wegerle (South Africa), rock-solid defenseman Arsene Auguste (Haiti), 1976 NASL goal scoring champion Derek Smethurst (South Africa), who was also the franchise's all-time leading goal scorer with 57 tallies in 65 games, as well as forward Clyde Best (Bermuda). Coached along the way by Firmani, John Boyle, Gordon Jago, Al Miller, and Marsh after his retirement, their catch phrase and marketing slogan was \"The Rowdies arrrre...a kick in the grass!\"\n\nParagraph 28: Between 1976–77 and 1981–82 Albert Rovers played in the League of Ireland.  In September 1976 Albert Rovers were elected to the league as replacements for Cork Hibernians. The team was managed by Noel O'Mahony and they made their League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers at Flower Lodge on 3 October 1976. Albert Rovers had requested the game be moved to avoid a clash with the Cork Senior Hurling Championship final but Shamrock Rovers refused. The visitors won 2–1 with Larry Wyse and Mick Leech scoring their goals. The 1977–78 season saw the League of Ireland team adopt the name Cork Albert and for 1978–79 they became Cork Alberts. As Cork Albert the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a second time in 1977–78, defeating Limerick in the final. They were finalists in the 1977–78 League of Ireland Cup but lost out to Dundalk on penalties. England international Bobby Tambling finished his playing career with Cork Alberts while John Meyler also played for the club during this era. Following the demise of Cork Celtic in 1979, the club was Cork city's sole representative in the League of Ireland and the team adopted the name Cork United for the 1979–80 season. The club retained the Cork United name for the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons. Cork United managed to sign some notable players including Miah Dennehy, Ian Callaghan and Ian Hutchinson but they never managed to make the move beyond mid-table. As Cork United the club won the Munster Senior Cup for a third and fourth time in 1979–80 and 1981–82. In the finals they defeated Crosshaven and Waterford respectively. In December 1981 the club invested heavily in bringing Manchester City to Turners Cross for a friendly. Hampered by postponements and cancellations, the club slipped into debt and they were unable to pay Manchester City their £8,000 appearance fee. As a result, they were subsequently expelled from the League of Ireland.\n\nParagraph 29: The Cycadeoideaceae (originally “Cycadeoideae”) were named by English geologist William Buckland in 1828, from fossil trunks found in Jurassic strata on the Isle of Portland, England, which Buckland gave the genus name Cycadeoidea. Buckland provided a description of the family and two species, but failed to give a description of the genus, which has led to Buckland's description of the family being considered invalid by modern taxonomic standards. In publications in 1870, Scottish botanist William Carruthers and English paleobotanist William Crawford Williamson described the first known reproductive organs of the Bennettitales from Jurassic strata of Yorkshire and Jurassic-Cretaceous strata of the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Portland. Caruthers was the first to recognise that Bennettitales had distinct differences from cycads, and established the tribes \"Williamsonieae\" and \"Bennettiteae\", with the latter being named after the genus Bennettites named by Caruthers in the same publication, the name being in honour of British botanist John Joseph Bennett. The order Bennettitales was erected by German botanist Adolf Engler in 1892, who recognised the group as separate from the Cycadales. The Anthophyte hypothesis erected by Arber and Parking in 1907 posited that angiosperms arose from Bennettitales, as suggested by the wood-like structures and rudimentary flowers. Based on morphological data, however, Bennettitales were classified as a monophyletic group when paired with Gnetales. a study in 2006 suggested that Bennettitales, Angiosperms, and Gigantopteridales form a clade based on the presence of oleanane. A 2007 study examining phase-contrast X-ray images of gymnosperm seeds supported the Anthophyte hypothesis. Evidence from seed coats suggest that Bennettitales form a clade with the gymnosperm orders of Gnetales and Erdtmanithecales. Molecular evidence has consistently contradicted the Anthophyte hypothesis, finding that Angiosperms are the sister group to all living gymnosperms, including Gnetales. A 2017 phylogeny based on molecular signatures of fossilised cuticles found that Bennettitales were more closely related to the Ginkgo+Cycads clade than conifers, and were closely related to Nilssonia and Ptilozamites.\n\nParagraph 30: At the World Future Energy Summit (WFES) held in Abu Dhabi in January 2018, the government of India announced the setting up of a $350 million solar development fund to enable financing of solar projects. Prime Minister Narendra Modi promoted solar energy during the plenary speech at World Economic Forum annual meet in Davos in 2018 and invited investments in the sector in India promising ease of doing business. Modi's ambitious plan when announced in the leading up to the Paris COP21 climate summit received much skepticism and the government's strategy to scale-up the renewable energy by relying on competitive bidding to reduce the cost was regarded as infeasible. However, starting around 2016–2017, new renewable energy became cheaper to build than running existing coal-fired plants in India. As of January 2018, 65% of coal power generation in India is being sold at higher rates than new renewable energy bids in competitive power auctions. India has scrapped tenders for coal-fired power stations and around 80% of new coal-fired power plants under planning have been halted or canceled. In the month of May 2017 alone, plans for building coal power for nearly 14 GW – about the same as the total amount in the UK – were canceled on account of declining solar costs. Analyst Tim Buckley said “Measures taken by the Indian Government to improve energy efficiency coupled with ambitious renewable energy targets and the plummeting cost of solar has had an impact on existing as well as proposed coal fired power plants, rendering an increasing number as financially unviable. India’s solar tariffs have literally been free falling in recent months.\" As reported by NYTimes in May 2017, \"According to research released last week at a United Nations climate meeting in Germany, China and India should easily exceed the targets they set for themselves in the 2015 Paris Agreement..... India is now expected to obtain 40 percent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2022, eight years ahead of schedule.\"\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1982, Albert Rovers, later known as Cork Albert and Cork United, played in the League of Ireland. They replaced Cork Hibernians in September 1976 and made their debut against Shamrock Rovers. Despite requesting a change in the game's date, they lost 2-1, with Larry Wyse and Mick Leech scoring for Shamrock Rovers. As Cork Albert and Cork Alberts, the team won the Munster Senior Cup in 1977-78, and were finalists in the League of Ireland Cup in the same season. Bobby Tambling, an England international, played for Cork Alberts, and they became Cork city's sole representative in the League of Ireland after Cork Celtic's demise in 1979. They later adopted the name Cork United and won the Munster Senior Cup for a third and fourth time in 1979-80 and 1981-82.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: In 1935, Sadler concluded that the papers found in the sleeping patient's house were not a hoax, citing their \"genuineness and insight\", and arguing that the sleeping man was not a medium for the dead, but was used by living beings to communicate. Papers ceased appearing in the sleeping man's house in the 1930s; Sadler then took a clear role as leader of the discussion group. The forum discontinued their discussion meetings in 1942, and The Urantia Book was published in 1955; it purportedly contained information from the celestial beings who had spoken through the sleeping man. The Urantia Book presents itself as the fifth \"epochal\" revelation God has given to humanity, and states that its purpose is to help humanity evolve to a higher form of life. It has four sections. The first section covers the nature of God and the universe, the second describes the portions of the universe nearest to Earth and Lucifer's rebellion, the third details the history of Earth and human religions, and the fourth provides an account of Jesus's life and accompanying doctrines. Sadler maintained that the teachings of the book were \"essentially Christian\" and \"entirely harmonious with ... known scientific facts\". Although Sadler had left the Adventist church by the time The Urantia Book was published, its teachings are broadly consistent with some aspects of Adventist theology, such as soul sleep and annihilationism. Journalist Brook Wilensky-Lanford argues in her 2011 profile of the Urantia movement that Sadler's departure from the Adventist church gave him the desire to build a new religious movement, citing the emphasis that Sadler placed on the discussion of the Garden of Eden in The Urantia Book as evidence of his desire to start anew. Sadler hoped that the content of the revelation would convince people of its worth, and did not attempt to win supporters by emphasizing its author. Wilensky-Lanford argues that Sadler attempted to avoid placing an individual at the center of his beliefs owing to his disappointment in Ellen White; however, Gardner believes that Sadler placed his faith in Wilfred Kellogg as he had in White.\n\nParagraph 2: The one minister whose proposals may have helped Britain to recover quickly from the worst effects of the Great Depression was Oswald Mosley, a former member of the Conservative Party. Frustrated by the government's economic orthodoxy (a controversial policy upheld by the fiscally conservative Chancellor, Philip Snowden), Mosley submitted an ambitious set of proposals for dealing with the crisis to the Labour Cabinet in what became known as \"Mosley's Memorandum\". These included much greater use of credit to finance development through the public control of banking, rationalisation of industry under public ownership, British agricultural development, import restrictions and bulk purchase agreements with foreign (particularly Imperial) producers, protection of the home market by tariffs, and higher pensions and allowances to encourage earlier retirement from industry and to increase purchasing power. Although MacDonald was sympathetic to some of Mosley's proposals, they were rejected by Snowden and other members of the Cabinet, which led Mosley to resign in frustration in May 1930. The government continued to adhere to an orthodox economic course, as characterised by the controversial decision of the Minister of Labour Margaret Bondfield to push through Parliament an Anomalies Act, aimed at stamping out apparent \"abuses\" of the unemployment insurance system. This legislation limited the rights of short-time, casual and seasonal workers and of married women to claim unemployment benefit, which further damaged the reputation of the government amongst Labour supporters. Bondfield was caught between the financial orthodoxy of Snowden, the critics of cuts on Labour's backbenches and the baying for even more cuts on the Opposition benches, and in the end she ended up satisfying none of them.\n\nParagraph 3:  In the Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \"459\", this Captain Marvel has some aspects of the Ultimate version/Mahr-Vehl, like his full name and rank, powers, human alias, and even appearance. Here, he is portrayed as a blue-skinned Kree rather than his traditional appearance as a \"Pink Kree,\" and uses the human alias \"Philip Lawson.\" He does not have the Nega-Bands, but makes use of highly advanced shape-shifting Kree weaponry. He helps the Avengers save Earth from a Kree Sentry sent to purge it of human life so the Kree can use the planet in their war against the Skrulls. He is distrusted by the team, particularly the Wasp, due to him being a Kree, but nearly sacrifices himself to take the robot's bomb into space and save earth. Afterwards he leaves to plead with the Supreme Intelligence to spare Earth, though he warns that the Kree will try to take Earth again. As he returns in \"Welcome to the Kree Empire\", He is accommodated by superiors commander Yon-Rogg and the Kree Grand Accuser Ronan who had been tasked by the Supremor to judge whether Earth's citizens were fit to join the empire. They were soon met with resistance by S.W.O.R.D and its newest agent Ms. Marvel, an associate of Mar-Vell's from when he went by his Lawson identity; exposure from his Kree Navy battle gear had augmented her genetic structure giving Carol cosmic superpowers. Mar-Vell begged her and the rest of earths heroes as well as its people to surrender peacefully, only to be violently rebuked, this defiance sending Ronan and the rest of his soldiers on the warpath. In a desperate attempt to stop all hostilities at the U.N. site, Captain Marvel intercepts a blast exchange between Ms. Marvel and Ronan; begging one last time for Earth to surrender to the Kree in order to spare mankind the galactic emperium's wrath. After Ronan is defeated Marvel and the rest of the invading Kree forces are imprisoned within Prison 42, an extra-dimensional prison in the Negative Zone. He warns that the Kree Empire will now come in full force after having humiliated the planets would be conquerors, but Iron Man retorts that they'll be waiting. He is voiced by Roger Craig Smith.\n\nParagraph 4: Young and Giroux began making art together in 2002. Their practice combines sculptural works, film, and public art.  In the artists' own words, they describe their art practice as \"the product of an ongoing conversation concerning the modernity of the mid-century, the production of space and the built environment.\"  As critic John Bentley Mays notes, the modernity that interests Young and Giroux is \"popular and mass cultural, a phenomenon in which the most prized characteristic is mechanical functionality, not (as in the fine arts) clever or beautiful appearances.\" Manufactured components found in the contemporary world often comprise the material for Young and Giroux's art. For instance, an early sculpture by the duo called Access (2004) is made with galvanized steel ductwork, while Excel (2004) is composed of steel strut and fluorescent light fixtures. Later works like Andersson (2010) or The Terrorizers (2010) combine powder coated aluminum with milled IKEA furniture to create hybrid structures. While these sculptures' make reference to the way IKEA products embody \"a convergence of modernist ideals and late capitalism,\" the artists also make clear that they take an interest in the manufactured world as a palette for the making of abstract works, consistent with the traditions of the plastic arts. Young and Giroux's film work focuses on the built environment. Every Building, or Site, that a Building Permit Has Been Issued for a New Building in Toronto in 2006 (2008) is a sequence of 8 – 10 second long static shots of 130 Toronto addresses, all of which meet the criteria of the title. In some ways, an informal sociological study, \"constructed in nearly equal units\" the film \"is also a sculpture,\" as critic Peggy Gale points out. Young and Giroux's Infrastructure Canada (2010–12) takes a similar approach, filming large-scale public works—such as dams and bridges - at a range of locations across Canada. The end result is a portrait of the \"material basis of the very idea of Canada\". Young and Giroux have done a number of public art projects. Reticulated Gambol (2007-2008), located at the Lee Centre Park in Toronto, Ontario, creates a functioning jungle gym that reflects on the conventions of this typical urban form. Nearly 12 meters square in size, the work combines a series of cupolas with bridges to create a large unified structure that, in width and height, sits at the limits of what is possible within the city building codes regulating the climbing gym format. Giroux comments, \"The playground equipment was a found language – we simply clarified the structure\".\n\nParagraph 5: It turns out that Solomon's Grimoire is not missing, but instead was being used as a trap for Philippa.  Ayesha, the twins' grandmother (whom they do not know of until the end of the book), wished to kidnap Philippa so that she would be the next Blue Djinn, as Ayesha's life was rapidly expiring. Jockeying for her position was Mimi de Ghulle, a wicked djinn from the tribe of Ghul; however, she is having little success. John goes in search of Philippa, who is being held at the Blue Djinn's secret palace in Babylon. The twin's favorite uncle, Nimrod, also goes in search of an acceptable alternative to Philippa as the next Blue Djinn.  The book alternates between John's search for Philippa, told in third person narration, and Philippa's experiences, told in first person in the form of a diary.  Philippa discovers that the Blue Djinn's powers to be beyond good and evil come from the Garden of Eden's Tree of Logic.  Slowly Philippa loses her humanity as the Tree has greater and greater effects on her.  John, in his search, faces numerous obstacles in finding and reaching the palace. He is aided by two of his uncles, Alan and Neil, who were turned into dogs by his mother for attempting the murder of their brother, John and Philippa's father, Edward, for his fortune. In addition, John attains a copy of The Bellili Scrolls, a map to the palace, and of its underground locale, Iravotum. The book climaxes when John reaches the palace and manages to rescue Philippa. However, during their traversal of Iravotum, Alan and Neil attack a large bird, called the Rukkh, that was attacking the group, biting its legs. However, the dogs did not let go, and fell to the ground, killing them. It is later revealed that Layla's binding of the human Alan and Neil would last only as long as the physical bodies of the dogs they inhabit, leaving the human Alan and Neil alive.\n\nParagraph 6: Machen received a base salary of $432,808 and $285,000 in annual performance bonuses, with his total annual compensation equalling $751,000, the fourth largest salary in the country for a public university president in 2007.  He has been criticized for reducing funding to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences by both faculty and other administrators.  However, in December 2008, Machen announced that he would give his yearly bonus of $285,000 back to the University of Florida with the stipulation that the money had to be used to help fund the Florida Opportunity Scholars Program.  When Machen was hired by the University of Florida in 2003, his contract stated he would be eligible, after five years, to receive either a one-year sabbatical (paid leave) or receive the $450,000 bonus in addition to his annual salary.  In January 2009, Machen chose to take $400,000 in four annual installments, but after receiving the first $100,000 installment in 2009, it was realized that the four-year payment plan would require Machen to pay federal income taxes on all four installments at the time of the first installment payment.  In March 2010, the Board of Trustees voted to pay the remaining three installments in a single lump sum so that Machen might avoid further negative tax consequences.  With the addition of the $300,000 lump-sum payment to his base salary and annual performance bonus, Machen's total compensation was approximately $1,050,000 in 2010.  Machen's contract ended in 2013.\n\nParagraph 7: The embodiment of the Gopher mascot came to life in 1952 when University of Minnesota assistant bandmaster Jerome Glass bought a fuzzy wool gopher suit with a papier-mâché head and asked one of the band members to climb into it.  \"Goldy\" Gopher (the first name seems to have appeared sometime in the 1960s) became a fixture within the University of Minnesota Marching Band and Pep Band, as each year a band member was chosen to don the suit for that season. Wherever these two bands performed, Goldy was there to glad-hand with the crowd, hug the little kids, torment the cheerleaders and generally add a friendly Minnesota flavor to the event.\n\nParagraph 8: Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote, \"At the end of California Split we realize that Altman has made a lot more than a comedy about gambling; he's taken us into an American nightmare, and all the people we met along the way felt genuine and looked real.\" Lauding the film as \"a great movie and [...] a great experience, too,\" he awarded it a full four stars. Vincent Canby in The New York Times called it \"a fascinating and vivid movie, not quite comparable to any other movie that I can immediately think of.\" He praised the film for being \"dense with fine, idiosyncratic detail, a lot of which is supplied by Mr. Gould and Mr. Segal as well as by members of the excellent supporting cast.\" He put it on his year-end unranked list of the best films of 1974. Gene Siskel liked most of the film and awarded three out of four stars, but disliked the ending for \"events too pat and a moral that's banal.\" A review by Arthur D. Murphy in Variety reported that \"the film is technically and physically handsome, all the more so for being mostly location work, but lacks a cohesive and reinforced sense of story direction. The stars have done better comedy before.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times was negative, writing that \"for the most part, 'California Split' seems one very long and very loud actors workshop improv, done in card parlors and casinos instead of on a bare stage. The garbled, stomped-on, incomprehensible dialogue which was annoying in the early stages of 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller' here seems so self-indulgently and needlessly overdone as to give a whole new dimension to the splitting headache.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it \"a slight but cheerful and beguiling episodic comedy.\"\n\nParagraph 9: The play debuted on Sunday, January 6, 1935, at the Civic Repertory Theatre on 14th Street, as part of a benefit performance for New Theatre magazine. It premiered on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on March 26, 1935, under the auspices of the Group Theatre, a New York City theatre company founded by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg, of which Odets was a member. The company was founded as a training ground for actors, and also to support new plays, especially those that expressed the social and political climate of the day. The play was requested by many theater and labor groups in numerous other cities around the United States. It premiered in London in 1936 at Unity Theatre, and was revived there most recently in 2013.\n\nParagraph 10: Towards the end of 2013, around the launch of Sony's next video game device, the home video game console the PlayStation 4, Sony began making comments in regard to the change in focus with the Vita. Yoshida stated that Sony would be releasing fewer first party games for the platform. Sony Computer Entertainment's Product Planning & Platform Software Innovation Director Don Mesa stated that the \"economics simply don’t work with the traditional process\". Sony addressed the \"economics of Vita game development\" issue with beginning on focusing on the fact that almost all PlayStation 4 games could be streamed and played through a Vita through Remote Play. Sony attempted to attach the device to the PS4 due to its extreme popularity; it took only a few weeks for the sales to surpass the sales of the Vita over the course of almost two years. In July 2014, Yoshida stated that the company would focus on it less as a dedicated handheld video game console, and more on its combination of uses, stating \"it's not about individual Vita games any more. It's more about how Vita can have multiple uses – with PS4 Remote Play, PS3 games with PS Now, and the dedicated games. The whole ecosystem with PS4 at the center, the Vita's a part of that.\" Sony later announced that the Vita will have PlayStation VR integration in the form of a second screen as well. Open beta trials for PlayStation Now functionality on the PS Vita began on October 14, 2014 in North America. The PlayStation TV, released across late 2013 and 2014, also aimed to expand the system's userbase by allowing for Vita games to be played on a television like a home console, though the device was discontinued in the West by the end of 2015, and did not fare well in Japan's handheld-focused region either. In November 2014, SCEA president Shawn Layden suggested that the new approach was working on hardware level, stating that Vita sales had increased since the implementation of PS4 Remote Play, though he and another Sony representative did not give specific figures. Sony continued to make games for the device, though in smaller number than in past. The last major Sony-developed title, Freedom Wars, still found success, selling over 188,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan. The debut was the highest Sony game debut for the system, and the second highest, only to Namco Bandai's late 2013 release of God Eater 2 on the platform.\n\nParagraph 11: Ellen Price was born in Worcester in 1814. In 1836 she married Henry Wood, who worked in the banking and shipping trade in Dauphiné in the South of France, where they lived for 20 years. On the failure of Wood's business, the family (including four children) returned to England and settled in Upper Norwood near London, where Ellen Wood turned to writing. This supported the family. Henry Wood died in 1866. She wrote over 30 novels, many of which (especially East Lynne) enjoyed remarkable popularity. Among the best known are Danesbury House, Oswald Cray, Mrs. Halliburton's Troubles, The Channings, Lord Oakburn's Daughters and The Shadow of Ashlydyat. Her writing tone would be described as \"conservative and Christian,\" occasionally expressing religious rhetoric.\n\nParagraph 12: Armed assault version of the Mi-8AMT, can carry the same range of weapons as the Mi-24 including unguided weapons and high-precision armaments, in particular, antitank guided 9M120 Ataka or 9M114 Shturm missiles. Fitted with a new large door on the right side (except the prototype), aramid fiber plates around the cockpit area and engines, and sometimes a loading ramp in place of the usual clamshell doors. The helicopter can carry up to 37 paratroopers, 12 wounded on stretchers or airlift up to 4 tons of cargo, engage in search-and-rescue and evacuation operations. The craft has two VK-2500 engines of enhanced capacity and a complex of defense means. The cockpit of the new helicopter is equipped with multifunctional indicators to display the map of the terrain and the latest navigational and piloting equipment which operates with GPS and GLONASS satellite navigation systems. The Russian air force received a first batch of 10 Mi-8AMTSh in December 2010, and a second batch in June 2011. Deliveries were continued in 2012 and 2013. Russian Defense Ministry signed a contract for 40 helicopters in August 2013. First 8 upgraded helicopters were delivered in 2014. In total, 40 helicopters were delivered in 2014. Long-term government contract to supply modernized Mi-8AMTSh was signed in Ulan-Ude in August 2013 and provides for the delivery of unique machines – the first production batch with improved resource performance including significant savings on maintenance during the life cycle of the helicopter. Mi-8AMTSh passed to the Defense Ministry obtains a larger capacity engines VK-2500 with an upgraded (reinforced) transmission that provide objective control of exploratory work, and make the use of the helicopter in the highlands and hot climates more efficient. 13 helicopters were delivered in 2015. 8 helicopters were delivered in the first half of 2016. More than 20 Mi-8AMTs and Mi-8AMTShs were delivered to the Russian Interior Ministry in recent years. Mi-8AMTSh-VA arctic version is also supplied to the Russian Air Force and Naval Aviation. The first batch of Mi-8AMTSh for 2017 was delivered in late May. A new delivery in June 2017. 13 more in early 2018. A new large delivery in June 2018. The last delivery held in December 2018. A new delivery of a special modification held in early 2019. New deliveries in November 2019 and April 2020. 10 Mi-8AMTSH-VN Special Ops helicopters are on order since summer 2019 and the first helicopters reportedly entered service as of late 2021. 2 helicopters were delivered and 6 modernized with the Vitebsk onboard defense system in July 2020.\n\nParagraph 13: Beet's best friend and partner, Beet met Kissu two years into his training, and was amazed with Kissu's abilities. Kissu is different from other Busters because he is a master of all five types of Divine Power, while most Busters only use one. He is also exceptionally intelligent and able to notice even the smallest details and find a solution to complicated problems in a matter of seconds. He is not confident with himself and is wary of living up to his dreams but he wants to be bolder like Beet. Therefore, one day Beet and Kissu decide to make goals they wish to achieve. Beet's goal is to end the Dark Century, while Kissu decides to be the world's greatest master of the Divine Attack. Though it was time for both to take different paths, Beet went on with his training, defeating all kinds of Vandels. Kissu, meanwhile, decided to join another Buster team which took him in. As they traveled, Kissu was always treated as a weakling by his peers, until one day, a powerful Vandel appeared and challenged them. Seeing that the Vandel was beyond their powers, the team told Kissu to distract the Vandel with his Divine Attack while the others prepared a devastating attack to eliminate it. Kissu accepted and attacked the Vandel with all he had, which was useless. When he turned back to give the signal of attack, his partners were escaping-Kissu was used as a sacrificial lamb. Shocked, Kissu stood there while the Vandel struck the team with his power, killing them. To his surprise, the Vandel spared him since he was brave enough to attack him. As his partners had attempted to escape, the Vandel granted them death instead. Devastated, Kissu started to ponder the nature of humans. He traveled without direction until he stopped at a Vandel ruin, admiring them and beginning think how noble Vandels truly were. That was when he met Grineed, who was amazed that a human was looking at Vandel ruins. Seeing this, he took advantage of Kissu and decided to take him as his henchman, placing on him a poisonous bracelet, the symbol of Grineed's influence over Kissu. Kissu stayed with Grineed and obeyed every order that was given him, until one day, the one person that had changed his life came back-Beet. Then, he became ambiguous as to which side to stick with: the Vandel's or Beet's? After Beet defeated Frausky, Grineed's henchman, they were attacked by Rozzgoat, another powerful Vandel under Grineed. During the battle, he stood between Rozzgoat and a weakened Beet. At this point he decided that he would never leave his friend and would fulfill his dreams alongside him.\n\nParagraph 14: Control theory stresses how weak bonds between the individuals and society free people to deviate or go against the norms, or the people who have weak ties would engage in crimes so they could benefit, or gain something that is to their own interest. This is where strong bonds make deviance more costly. Deviant acts appear attractive to individuals but social bonds stop most people from committing the acts. Deviance is a result of extensive exposure to certain social situations where individuals develop behaviors that attract them to avoid conforming to social norms. Social bonds are used in control theory to help individuals from pursuing these attractive deviations.\n\nParagraph 15:  Tomato Guy (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - A character who appeared in every episode of the show. He would shout \"Tomato\" only to cause anybody in the area to panic. This was presumably inspired by the character Costa Dillon played in the original Attack of the Killer Tomatoes film, who simply says \"Tomato\" in a library and scares all of the patrons so much that they run out of the classroom screaming in fear. As an additional sidenote, Tomato Guy is usually used as a speaking extra in various episodes when he is not shouting \"Tomato\" (this feat was also performed by Costa Dillon, who portrayed several roles such as a reporter, police guard, representative of the Screen Actors' Guild and more in \"Return of the Killer Tomatoes\"). It was later revealed in the Season Two episode \"Stemming The Tide\" that he makes fun of tomatoes because as a kid, he was served cold tomato soup at a family get-together (his cousin, who turned off the stove, bore a significant resemblance to a young Putrid T. Gangreen, though it was never made clear if the two of them were actually related). In any case, the soup was alive and pestering Tomato Guy until he captured it by covering his soup bowl with a saucer. He then cooked it on his relatives' stove. In Season One he is seen as a customer at Finletter's Pizza. Tara as a waitress is asking him to please make up his mind for a topping, after all, he could not kill anyone. The man responds \"OK, do you have tomato?\", which sends Tara into shock and reminds her of her horrible creation. She is revived by Uncle Wilbur who reassures her that the police have arrested him (presumably for violating the tomato prohibition laws) and that he will not be in the pizza parlor again for some time. His voice and design resembles that of Woody Allen.\n\nParagraph 16: The Greek Liturgy of St. James follows in all its essential parts that of the Apostolic Constitutions. It has preparatory prayers to be said by the priest and deacon and a blessing of incense. Then begins the Mass of the Catechumens with the little Entrance. The deacon says a litany (’ekténeia), to each clause of which the people answer \"Kyrie Eleison\". The priest meanwhile silently recites a prayer, raising his voice only for the last words, when the litany has ended. The singers say the Trisagion, \"Holy God, holy Strong One, holy Immortal One, have mercy on us.\" The practice of the priest saying one prayer silently while the people are occupied with something different is a later development. The Lessons follow, still in the older form, that is, long portions of both Testaments, then the prayers for the catechumens and their dismissal. Among the prayers for the catechumens occurs a reference to the cross (lift  the horn of the Christians by the power of the venerable and life-giving cross) which must have been written after St. Helen found it (c. 326) and which is one of the many reasons for connecting this liturgy with Jerusalem. When the catechumens are dismissed, the deacon tells the faithful to \"know each other\", that is to observe whether any stranger is still present. The great Entrance which begins the Mass of the Faithful is already an imposing ceremony. The incense is blessed, and the oblation is brought from the Prothesis to the altar while the people sing the Cherubikon, ending with three Alleluias. (The text is different from the Byzantine Cherubikon.) Meanwhile, the priest says another prayer silently. The creed is then said; apparently, at first, it was a shorter form like the Apostles' Creed. The Offertory prayers and the litany are much longer than those in the Apostolic Constitutions. There is as yet no reference to an Iconostasis (screen dividing the choir or place of the clergy). The beginning of the \"Anaphora\" (Preface) is shorter. The words of Institution and Anamimnesis are followed immediately by the Epiklesis; then comes the Supplication for various people. The deacon reads the \"Diptychs\" of the names of the people for whom they pray; then follows a list of Saints beginning with \"our all-holy, immaculate and highly praised Lady Mary, Mother of God and ever-virgin.\" Here are inserted two hymns to Our Lady directed against the Nestorian heresy. The Lord's Prayer follows with an introduction and Embolismos. The Host is shown to the people with the same words as in the Apostolic Constitutions, and then broken, and part of it is put into the chalice while the priest says: \"The mixing of the all-holy Body and the precious Blood of Our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" Before Communion Psalm xxxiii is said. The priest says a prayer before his Communion. The deacon communicates with the people. There is no such form as: \"The Body of Christ\"; he says only: \"Approach in the fear of the Lord\", and they answer, \"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.\" What is left of the Blessed Sacrament is taken by the deacon to the Prothesis; the prayers of thanksgiving are longer than those of the Apostolic Constitutions.\n\nParagraph 17: In the early years of Maine's program, the rivalry was one-sided and had not yet truly formed, as Boston University dominated Maine on the ice, defeating them 13 consecutive times between 1982 and 1986, one of the worst losing streaks to a single opponent in Maine's history. Once legendary Black Bears coach Shawn Walsh took over the program, however, the tides started to turn, and Maine began to make up ground. One notable meeting between the teams occurred on February 19, 1993, at Alfond Arena in Orono, home of the Black Bears. Maine was in the midst of an unprecedentedly successful season, having entered that contest with a record of 30-0-2. Midway through the third period, Maine was leading by a score of 6-2, and it appeared they would cruise to another easy victory. However, the Terriers would rally, and manage to score four unanswered third period goals to tie the game at 6-6 and send it to overtime. In the overtime period, Terriers forward Mike Prendergast would get a breakaway from center ice and proceed to score the game-winning goal for the Terriers, giving them a stunning 7-6 victory and handing Maine their first loss of the season. Prendergast would say after the game, \"My sister could have scored that goal\" to taunt the Maine players and fans. However, this would end up as Maine's only loss the entire season, as they would not lose another game all season and win their first national title with a stunning 42-1-2 record, including defeating the Terriers twice more by a combined score of 11-3. Boston University would have their revenge, however, winning a national championship of their own in 1995, defeating Maine in the national title game 6-2. The on-ice rivalry between the schools was often overshadowed by the personal rivalry between the coaches, Walsh for Maine and BU's own legendary coach Jack Parker. Both men were impassioned and bombastic coaches, and as such drew the ire of each other and of opposing fans. While they often had choice words for each other during their coaching careers, Parker spoke kindly of Walsh during his cancer treatment and following his 2001 death. While some fans view Boston College and New Hampshire as BU and Maine's historical and primary rivals, respectively, fans from the heat of the rivalry in the 1990s and early 2000s may report that in their opinion, either Maine or BU is their schools true rival, not UNH or BC. Even after Walsh's 2001 death, the rivalry has remained heated and competitive, meeting in the Hockey East playoff tournament in 2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2012, with Maine winning each matchup aside from 2009. The two teams also met in the NCAA National Tournament in 2002, with Maine emerging victorious. On January 24, 2004, the two teams combined for 268 penalty minutes in one game, a men's college hockey record that stands to this day, and stood as the all-levels, both genders record until 2013. The majority of the penalty minutes were accrued during a brawl at the end of the game, which was a 1-0 victory for Boston University. Even as Maine's team performance has declined in the latter part of the 2010s, games between the teams remain tense, chippy affairs, and simultaneous success for the teams would lead to a rejuvenation of the once-heated rivalry.\n\nParagraph 18: The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Conendovre, and the Norman manor house is believed to have stood on the site now occupied by Church House, a short distance north west of the Church. It would also appear that there was a mill on the Cound Brook in the village which produced a good annual income. At the time of the Domesday census, Condover was held by Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, who had been granted seven-eighths of Shropshire by his cousin William I in 1071. The revenues of the manor were later forfeited by Robert de Bellême, Earl Roger's next but one successor, and returned to Royal hands under Henry I. As with other royal manors, the affairs of Condover were managed by the local Shire reeve or sheriff, whose duty it was to keep the King's forest and manor well stocked and maintained.\n\nParagraph 19: Nearly six months later, on September 17, 2018, Feder reported that the MBC's board of directors was close to finalizing a deal to sell the museum's third and fourth floors to Fern Hill, a real estate development and investment firm. \"Sources said the agreement will net $6 million, to be used to continue operating the museum and paying down debt – especially a $3.7 million mortgage held by Pepper Construction Co.,\" Feder wrote. The deal closed on March 1, 2019, with executive director Julian Jackson telling Feder, \"When we open the next phase of the permanent museum, we plan on providing a state-of-the-art experience to all of our guest [sic], while delivering brand value to our sponsors and supporters.\" That same week the Chicago Tribune reported that the MBC was \"negotiating with Cleveland’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to bring two special exhibitions here beginning in June,\" and that after the March 31 closing of \"Saturday Night Live: The Experience,\" which had been held over for three months, the museum's second floor was \"expected to be closed for at least April and May\" as the MBC reduced its exhibition and event space \"from 25,000 square feet to 12,500.\" On March 18, 2019, Robert Feder reported that Julian Jackson had resigned as the MBC's executive director after one year, having told the board of directors that he'd \"accepted a new position with Freeman Exhibit Solutions in Schiller Park.\"\n\nParagraph 20: Historian Ishwari Prasad writes that different coins of different shapes and sizes were produced by his mints which lacked the artistic perfection of design and finish. In 1330, after his failed expedition to Deogiri, he issued token currency; that is coins of brass and copper were minted whose value was equal to that of gold and silver coins. Historian Ziauddin Barani felt that this step was taken by Tughluq as he wanted to annex all the inhabited areas of the world for which a treasury was required to pay the army. Barani had also written that the sultan's treasury had been exhausted by his action of giving rewards and gifts in gold. In the rural areas, officials like the muqaddams paid the revenue in brass and copper coins and also used the same coins to purchase arms and horses. As a result, the value of coins decreased, and, in the words of Satish Chandra, the coins became \"as worthless as stones\". This also disrupted trade and commerce. The token currency had inscriptions in Persian and Arabic marking the use of new coins instead of the royal seal and so the citizens could not distinguish between the official and the forged coins. Records show that the use of token currency had stopped by 1333 as Ibn Battuta who came to Delhi in 1334, wrote a journal which made no mention of this currency.\n\nParagraph 21: Dave DeBusschere and Jerry Lucas were selected before the draft as the 'Detroit Pistons' and 'Cincinnati Royals' territorial picks, respectively. Bill McGill from the University of Utah was selected first overall by the Chicago Zephyrs. Terry Dischinger from Purdue University, who went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award in his first season, was selected eight overall by the Chicago Zephyrs. Four players from this draft, DeBusschere, Lucas, seventh pick John Havlicek and twelfth pick Chet Walker, have been inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame. They were also named in the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list announced at the league's 50th anniversary in 1996. Lucas initially opted to sign for the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League (ABL). However, the Pipers folded before the start of the season and Lucas opted to sit out a year to complete his education. He eventually entered the NBA and went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award in the 1963–64 season. Lucas' achievements include an NBA championship with the New York Knicks in 1973, 5 All-NBA Team selections and 7 All-Star Game selections. DeBusschere's achievements include 2 NBA championships with the Knicks in 1970 and 1973, 1 All-NBA Team selection, 8 All-Star Game selections and 6 All-Defensive Team selections. In the 1964–65 season, he was named as a player-coach for the Pistons, becoming the youngest head coach in the NBA at the age of 24. He coached the Pistons for almost three years before returning to a full-time player. He also had a brief professional baseball career with the Chicago White Sox. He played two seasons in the Major League Baseball in 1962 and 1963, and another season in the minor-league before he gave up his dual-sport career to focus on basketball. He is one of only 12 athletes who have played in both NBA and MLB. Havlicek spent all of his 16-year playing career with the Boston Celtics. His achievements include 8 NBA championships with the Celtics, 1 Finals MVP, 11 All-NBA Team selection, 13 All-Star Game selections and 8 All-Defensive Team selections. Walker, the 12th pick, won the NBA championship with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1967 and was selected to 7 All-Star Games.\n\nParagraph 22: Madero was perceived unable to achieve order and stability that the U.S. government and businesses required. Wilson made it clear that he wanted Madero replaced and a candidate more amendable to the U.S. installed in the presidency. General Bernardo Reyes also sought regime change. Both men were imprisoned by Madero, but not executed and went on to lead a coup d'etat with support of the U.S. Ambassador.  Given activist U.S. interventions in Latin American internal affairs for decades, it was not out of the question that the U.S. would  intervene in Mexico in this unsettled period. When that did not happen, the ambassador played a decisive role in undermining the  Mexican public's and international diplomatic corps' as well as business interests' perception of the Madero's regime's ability to keep order. From January 1913, a coup against Madero seemed inevitable, supported by the U.S.  The plot by Díaz and Reyes against Madero was sprung in February 1913 in a coup d'état during a period now known as the Ten Tragic Days (la decena trágica). which overthrew Madero. Wilson brought Félix Díaz and the head of the Mexican Federal Army, General Victoriano Huerta, who had ostensibly been a defender of the president but now in opposition to him. A signed agreement signed on 19 February, the Pact of the Embassy, laid out a power-sharing agreement between the two Mexican generals, with the explicit support of the U.S. ambassador. U.S. President William Howard Taft, who had appointed Wilson in 1909 as ambassador to Mexico, was a lame duck president, having lost the election to Woodrow Wilson. The new president would be inaugurated on March 4, 1913. In the final days of his presidency, President Madero,  at long last and too late realized the tenuousness of his hold on power. He appealed to President-elect Wilson to intervene on his behalf, but to no avail, since Wilson was not yet in office. Ambassador Wilson had secured the support of the foreign diplomatic corps in Mexico, especially the British, German, and French envoys, for the coup and lobbied for U.S. recognition of the new head of state, General Huerta.\n\nParagraph 23: As sheriff, Andy is the chief law enforcement officer in the county, yet most of his activity is in and around the town of Mayberry, and there is no evidence of a separate city police force. Both the town and the county are named Mayberry, so Andy is the chief law enforcement officer for both. These working conditions, plus his reliance on a single deputy (and no clerk or jailer) indicate that the county is very small in both size and population; however, in the episode Mountain Wedding, Andy and Barney get up at four o'clock in the morning to get an \"early start\" on their trip to the Darlings' cabin, which is described as being \"up in the mountains\". When they arrive, it is full daylight, so it could be inferred that Mayberry County is larger than originally thought and with mountainous areas, but sparsely populated. Andy and Barney both work the courthouse during daytime hours, and rotate shifts at night. The length of night duties is never specified; however, it appears the only time either spends all night at the courthouse is when a prisoner, other than regular inmate Otis Campbell, is incarcerated.  One confusing aspect of Andy's authority however, is his apparent subservience to the town mayor; a plot device which is utilized in several episodes throughout the course of the series - including Season 3's \"The Cow Thief\" - but which makes no sense in real life, since both are elected officials. Additionally, since Andy is elected countywide, while the mayor is a town official, his authority would actually - in most areas - exceed that of the mayor.  This apparent dichotomy is never addressed during the run of the show.\n\nParagraph 24: The company was founded by Noel C. Bloom as a direct opposite to an earlier company he founded, Caballero Home Video, which was a pioneering video distributor of hardcore adult fare. FHE released children's and family-oriented programming, most notably popular 1980s television cartoons, including The Transformers, G.I. Joe, Jem, ThunderCats, Inspector Gadget, Defenders of the Earth, Pound Puppies, the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series, Gumby, Clifford the Big Red Dog, The Care Bears, and Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars, and other non-animated shows like Baby Einstein and the Laurel and Hardy comedy series from the 1920s and 1930s by Hal Roach. FHE was one of the two distributors for most of the seasonal Rankin/Bass television specials aired on CBS, a relationship that began in 1989. The other distributor for this library was Vestron Video, a now-defunct company which would be ironically acquired by FHE's then-parent Live Entertainment in 1991. However, it would lose the home video rights to the Rankin/Bass library in 1998 to Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment. The company also released several VHS releases of British kids' cartoons and animation in the US (i.e., Roobarb, Wil Cwac Cwac, James the Cat and Fireman Sam), as well as some Japanese anime, such as Robotech and The Adventures of Ultraman, plus the Australian Dot films. Their output was not strictly targeted at children and families; in the early '80s, several titles were released under the \"World of Horror\" label directly by FHE, including Journey into the Beyond and The Child (which was later rebranded as a Monterey Home Video release). Beginning in 1982, they also released Filmation's TV shows such as Lassie's Rescue Rangers, The Lone Ranger, Shazam!, Blackstar, and The New Adventures of Zorro, plus the only Filmation movie released at the time, Journey Back to Oz.\n\nParagraph 25: Hillman also had a hand in writing the album's opening track, \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\".  With its satirical and sarcastic lyrics, the song was an acerbic, but good-natured swipe at the success of manufactured pop bands like the Monkees.  However, Connors has stated that \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" also suggests certain ironies due to pre-fabricated aspects of the Byrds' own origin, including drummer Michael Clarke having been initially recruited for his good looks, rather than for his musical ability.  As a result of this, music journalist David Fricke has said that some fans have mistaken \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" for an autobiographical song.  Hillman's driving bassline and McGuinn's chiming twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar riff form the core of the song, with the production being rounded off by the sound of screaming teenage fans, which had been recorded at a Byrds' concert in Bournemouth during the band's 1965 English tour.  South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela contributed the trumpet solo featured in the song, which represented the first use of brass on a Byrds' recording.  Masekela and the Byrds would later perform \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" together at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967.\n\nParagraph 26: Lucien Febvre first used the phrase \"histoire vue d'en bas et non d'en haut\" (history seen from below and not from above) in 1932 when praising Albert Mathiez for seeking to tell the \"histoire des masses et non de vedettes\" (history of the masses and not of starlets). It was also used in the title of A. L. Morton's 1938 book, A People's History of England. Yet it was E. P. Thompson's essay History from Below in The Times Literary Supplement (1966) which brought the phrase to the forefront of historiography from the 1970s. It was popularized among non-historians by Howard Zinn's 1980 book, A People's History of the United States.\n\nParagraph 27: In addition to celebrity interviews the magazine also includes serious features on a range of subjects, which have included the plight of gay asylum seekers and the rise of the far Right in Eastern Europe, the US presidential election campaign as well as real life editorial such as male rape and body image issues. In May 2005, on the eve of the UK general election, the magazine interviewed Tony Blair for the cover. In April 2008, Attitude took then Mayor of London Boris Johnson to task about his comments that \"if gay marriage was okay – and I was uncertain of that issue – then I saw no reason why a union should not therefore be consecrated between three men, as well as two men; or indeed three men and a dog\", a claim Johnson tried to justify as loose talk on Newsnight or Question Time, until reminded of a passage in his own book as a direct source.Attitude frequently acquires exclusive interviews within the gay market. These exclusives include Daniel Radcliffe's only gay press interview, Madonna's first worldwide press interview for her Confessions on a Dance Floor album, Elton John and David Furnish's only print interview for their civil partnership in December 2005, Heath Ledger's only gay press interview, Take That's first print interview after re-forming, Kylie Minogue, who always gives Attitude her launch interviews and Robbie Williams's only cover story interview on the release of his Greatest Hits album. Will Young has only ever given gay press interviews to Attitude. In 2006, The Scissor Sisters gave their first print interview for their new album to the magazine with an exclusive five cover edition, each cover featuring a different member of the band. Take That also gave their first magazine interview to Attitude after reforming and also posed for a four cover special in early 2009.\n\nParagraph 28: Although the scenario of a shared name might appear to suggest competing interests (and indeed there was resistance to a full merger proposed in the 1990s), several instructors have taught music concurrently at both institutions, and some signs of a healthy partnership have been evident between musicians and programs at these two schools which have rather different emphases. According to the history explained in Norwegian on the Grieg Academy-UiB's official website, “towards the end of the 1980s, the conservatory faced major restructuring, and a government report recommended closer cooperation with the University of Bergen. In the autumn of 1995, Nina Grieg's 150th birthday and 90 years after Torgrim Castberg first opened the Music Academy, the Conservatoire was founded as an ‘institute’ at the University of Bergen, and ‘Grieg Academy’ was established as a ceiling (or umbrella ...) of all music education programs under both the University of Bergen and Bergen University College.” Also, according to a 1996 report from the website of University of Bergen, “The Grieg Academy is a partnership between the University and Bergen University College who has since earlier been offering a major in music education. This academic partnership rests on three pillars: music pedagogy at the former teachers college and applied/creative music and musicology at the University.” Due to both marketing strategies and inter-institutional politics, the Grieg Academy-UiB has in recent years increasingly taken a public stance implying that it is \"the\" Grieg Academy, yet for those who know this history it remains undeniably clear that \"the Grieg Academy\" has actually referred to multiple institutions, University of Bergen and Bergen University College, with some forms of collaboration. In recent years, the folk music school Ole Bull Academy in nearby Voss (named after renowned violin virtuoso Ole Bull), has also been to some extent brought under the Grieg Academy umbrella. The name Grieg may be traced to Norway's most famous composer Edvard Grieg, a native son of Bergen, and the tradition of naming music schools after famous composers is evident across Europe, including the Sibelius Academy, Liszt Academy, and Mozarteum.\n\nParagraph 29: NMC has a branch campus on Grand Traverse Bay that houses the Great Lakes Culinary Institute, Great Lakes Maritime Academy, Great Lakes Water Studies Institute and Hagerty Conference Center. Another branch campus near Cherry Capital Airport is home to NMC's aviation and automotive service technology programs, and offers training in manufacturing, construction, renewable energy and information technology. NMC also has an observatory (the Rogers Observatory) and an ACEN (Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing) accredited nursing program that has a long-standing association with nearby Munson Medical Center. The campus is home to WNMC-FM, which began as a student organization in 1967, and is now a community radio station broadcasting at 90.7 FM.\n\nParagraph 30: Designed and constructed by the noted American shipbuilder, William H. Webb, the second Augusta was completed in 1853 at New York City and operated out of that port carrying passengers and freight for the New York and Savannah Steam Navigation Company on runs to Savannah, Georgia and New Orleans, Louisiana. Early in the Civil War, as the Union Navy was expanding its fleet for the Herculean task of blockading the Confederate coast, the Federal Government purchased the side-wheeler at New York on 1 August 1861. She was fitted out for naval service by the New York Navy Yard and commissioned there on 28 September 1861, Commander Enoch Greenleafe Parrott in command.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe Mi-8AMT is an armed assault version of the Mi-8 helicopter that is capable of carrying a range of weapons, including anti-tank missiles. It is equipped with new features such as aramid fiber plates for protection, a large door on the right side, and advanced cockpit instruments for navigation. The Russian air force received multiple batches of these helicopters between 2010 and 2014. The helicopters have also been supplied to the Russian Interior Ministry and have an arctic version for the Air Force and Naval Aviation. Deliveries of the helicopters continued in subsequent years, with the last special modification delivered in early 2019. Furthermore, in July 2020, two Mi-8AMTSH-VN Special Ops helicopters were delivered, with six others being modernized with the Vitebsk onboard defense system.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: The DOMCO mines were subsumed by the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO) in 1920, and BESCO management soon began a targeted campaign to break the union, organized as District 26, United Mine Workers of America. There were many small strikes in the Sydney coalfield between 1920 and 1925, but the longest, in 1925, lasted from March to August. When the latest contract  expired on January 15, 1925, BESCO refused to deal with the union and on March 2 cut off credit at the company stores. The union went on strike four days later, with 12,000 miners manning the picket lines, leaving a small workforce to maintain the mines and keep them from flooding. Despite the economic hardship which saw families come to the brink of starvation by June, the miners' resolve was strong. When BESCO refused arbitration, the union adopted a policy of 100 per cent picketing. This included shutting down operations at the pumping station and power plant at Waterford Lake, which would prevent the company from resuming operations in that district. On June 10, BESCO tasked its company police force to return to Waterford Lake with thirty company workers and continue its plan to restart the water and electricity to its facilities and to the parts of town that had the benefit of running water and power. The following morning on June 11, the company police began a patrol pattern of intimidation which led to small clashes throughout town, culminating in a protest by 700 to 3,000 striking miners who marched on the Waterford Lake in an attempt to persuade the company workers to support the strike. The company police were staring down the miners at 11:00 AM when the police charged the crowd, firing over 300 shots and injuring many. One police officer shot deliberately at Davis, piercing his heart and killing him within minutes. The company police force then retreated as the miners swarmed the facility. The coal miners also began attacking company stores and other coal company properties in the Sydney coalfield, resulting in the deployment of the provincial police force and almost 2,000 soldiers from the Canadian Army - the second-largest military deployment for an internal conflict in Canadian history after the North-West Rebellion of 1885. BESCO eventually accepted government intervention and agreed to settle the strike. BESCO gave up its attempts to break District 26 U.M.W.A., which by then had grown to become one of the most militant labour organizations on the continent. The company was eventually taken over and merged into a larger conglomerate in 1930 called the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO), but Industrial Cape Breton remained a hotbed of labour activism\n\nParagraph 2: When bowling, Trumble made the most of his height, bringing the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as \"sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird\". He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as Stanley Jackson, who said, \"You old devil. You get me caught-and-bowled whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later.\" He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day. In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer  away five times out of six. Johnnie Moyes named him as an \"immortal of the art\" who succeeded by \"attacking the batsman's strength\". W. G. Grace called him \"the best bowler Australia has sent us\". While Trumble was able to score 1,183 runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, prehensile fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and he was the first to take 20 catches in an Australian season. English cricketer Johnny Douglas said, \"Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field—his natural place would be up trees in the bush.\" He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to \"snatch\" at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.\n\nParagraph 3: Many J70s could be found working on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway in East Anglia only 28 miles (46 km) from Rev. W. Awdry's parish at Elsworth in Cambridgeshire in the same diocese.  Rev. W. Awdry wrote about Toby the Tram Engine in 1952, shortly before he was transferred to Emneth parish. The Tramway ran from Wisbech, through Emneth – the next station on the line – then through Outwell and Upwell. This area and its line was well known to Rev. W. Awdry who often visited Ely nearby. The Tramway was primarily used for the transportation of fruit and other farm produce to the main line at Wisbech. The line closed to passengers in 1927, but freight services continued until lorries and road transport boomed in the 1950s. In 1952, the steam tram engines were replaced by diesel Drewry Shunters (the BR Class 04). Inspiration for Toby came from the Awdrys watching a J70 – probably 68221, one of three J70s built in 1914 (as GER 127) – at Great Yarmouth in 1951. Further inspiration was drawn soon after when the Rev. 'Teddy' Boston, then curate at Wisbech, arranged for Awdry to ride on the footplate of one of the last surviving steam tram engines on the Tramway. Fascinated by the unusual engines, Awdry sought a way to incorporate them in the stories. Research by Awdry's brother, George, revealed that tramway regulations required the fitting of cowcatchers and sideplates for railway locomotives running on tracks alongside roads, and the story \"Thomas in Trouble\" (published in 1952, the year steam trams were replaced) evolved to provide a reason for Toby being summoned to Sodor. The story includes a description of Toby's final journeys on the line:\n\nParagraph 4: Once in America, Reinagle continued to compose short pieces for special occasions, often with titles alluding to American personalities and ideas. Pieces such as his Federal March, President Madison’s March and Mrs. Madison’s Minuet are usually short and in the binary form associated with dance music of the time. Of more interest is the set of four keyboard sonatas. Reinagle composed these when he first arrived in Philadelphia; hence they are sometimes called the \"Philadelphia Sonatas\". These are the first sonatas composed in the United States. They are substantial works, each in two or three movements. While they show the influence of C. P. E. Bach (one of Reinagle's idols), they demonstrate Reinagle's unique approach to form and motivic development.\n\nParagraph 5: After the break up, Valentine said that she felt lost and that her identity had become absorbed into being a Go-Go.  Returning to her rock roots, she formed the World's Cutest Killers, a line up she thought would be successful, featuring former Girlschool guitarist Kelly Johnson, her old friend Jesse Sublett on bass, drummer (future A&R man) Craig Aaronson, and keyboardist Jebin Bruni. The group attracted the attention of producer Mike Chapman and recorded demos, which were scrapped, and the band split up. Several other bands and line ups went nowhere, and Valentine returned to school. In 1990, the Go-Go's reunited for concerts and a CD of greatest hits, but split again soon after.\n\nParagraph 6: The work was commissioned by Princess Edmond de Polignac in October 1916. The Princess had specified that female voices should be used: originally the idea had been that Satie would write incidental music to a performance where the Princess and/or some of her (female) friends would read aloud texts of the ancient Greek philosophers. As Satie, after all, was not so much in favour of melodrama-like settings, that idea was abandoned, and the text would be sung — be it in a more or less reciting way. However, the specification remained that only female voices could be used (for texts of dialogues that were supposed to have taken place between men).\n\nParagraph 7: The national government and city of Paris continued to partner with NGOs in order to provide trafficking victims with a network of services and shelters during the reporting period. The government provided some indirect funding for victims’ care in 2009; however, it did not report overall funding allocations to NGOs for victims of trafficking. One NGO reported it received 20 percent of its budget from the government in 2009 but had to seek private funding in order to provide temporary housing for trafficking victims. Another NGO reported it worked with pro-bono medical and social service providers in order to assist victims of forced labor. A third NGO working with unaccompanied minors who are at risk of becoming victims of trafficking in France reported that it received 98 percent of its budget from the government in 2009. The government reported police and other authorities identified and referred 799 trafficking victims to NGOs for assistance in 2009; however, it reported that it did not officially collect or track data on the actual number or percentage of these identified victims that it referred for shelter and assistance. The NGO Committee Against Modern Slavery (CCEM) reported 216 cases of forced labor in France in 2008; 120 of these victims were reportedly placed in protective custody. The government increased its partnership with the Romanian government in order to improve the protection, return, and reintegration of Romani people unaccompanied minors. The French government provided witness protection services and issued one-year residency permits, which can be renewed every six months, to victims of trafficking who cooperated with authorities in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers; the government also provided identified victims with assistance and a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to cooperate with law enforcement. A trafficking victim may receive a permanent residency card though only if the defendant is successfully convicted by the government. The government did not report the number of victims that received residence permits or cards in 2009. One NGO continued to express frustration with the fees required for the residency permit and renewal of the permit. NGOs continued to provide monthly stipends to trafficking victims, with some of these stipends provided by the government. The government formally assists trafficking victims seeking return to their countries of origin, though fewer than five percent usually decide to do so. Although the border police reportedly used indicator cards to proactively identify victims, French border police do not have any systematic procedures in place to identify trafficking victims, according to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Some local observers continued to criticize the government's lack of a proactive approach to identifying trafficking victims and reported that some women in prostitution are arrested and fined for solicitation without being screened to determine if they are trafficking victims. To address this deficiency, the government reported it continued to provide mandatory training to all law enforcement personnel to increase their identification and awareness of potential trafficking victims in 2009.\n\nParagraph 8: The original Victor, launched on 28 February 1957, was coded the F series and saw a production run of more than 390,000 units. The car was of unitary construction and featured a large glass area with heavily curved windscreen and rear window. Following  American styling trends then current, the windscreen pillars (A-pillars) sloped forwards. In fact, the body style was derived directly from the classic ′55 Chevrolet Bel Air, though this is not apparent unless the two cars are viewed side by side. Bench seats were fitted front and rear trimmed in Rayon and \"Elastofab\", and two-colour interior trim was standard. The Super model had extra chrome trim, notably around the windows; remnants of the signature Vauxhall bonnet flutes ran along the front flanks and the exhaust pipe exited through the rear bumper.  The car was equipped with arm rests on the doors, door-operated courtesy lights, a two-spoke steering wheel, and twin sun visors.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1984, Maryland defeated the defending national champions, sixth-ranked Miami, in what was then the biggest comeback in college football history and judged by some as the most exciting. At half time, Maryland trailed Miami, 31–0. Back-up quarterback Frank Reich replaced Stan Gelbaugh and proceeded to throw four touchdown passes, and capitalizing on Miami errors, the Terrapins won, 42–40. The recovery from the 31–point halftime deficit stood as the greatest college football comeback for the next 22 years, until the record was finally broken by Michigan State against Northwestern. Reich later repeated the feat in his professional career when he led the Buffalo Bills to overcome a 32-point deficit and set the NFL comeback record. That season, Maryland also defeated 17th-ranked West Virginia in Morgantown and 20th-ranked Clemson at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore to avenge the 1983 loss at Death Valley, and secured the 1984 ACC Championship with a 45–34 victory over arch rival Virginia in Charlottesville. In the postseason, they edged Tennessee, 28–27, in the  and finished 12th in the nation. Maryland entered the 1985 season with a number-one preseason rank, and set its all-time home attendance record in Byrd Stadium with an average of 49,385 over five games. However, they dropped to a ranking of 17th in Week 2, and then out of the polls in Week 4 after a shutout by Michigan. Despite the early setbacks, the Terrapins finished undefeated in six conference games to take the ACC championship for the third consecutive year. Maryland defeated Syracuse, 35–18, in the Cherry Bowl and earned a final ranking of 18th. In 1986, the Terrapins may have posted a mediocre 5–5–1 record, one of the five losses was to the eventual 1986 National Champion Penn State by 2 points in State College due to a failed 2-point conversion that would have tied the game at 17, and the lone game that ended in a tie was against eventual ACC Champion Clemson at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore.\n\nParagraph 10: The mammoth steppe was dominated in biomass by reindeer, bison, horse, and the woolly mammoth, and was the center for the evolution of the Pleistocene woolly fauna. Megaloceros, saiga antelope and musk ox also lived on the mammoth steppe (the first one not in the northernmost parts). In the Siberian parts were animals like the argali, Snow sheep and the Mongolian gazelle. Not so far before the last glacial maximum (roughly 40.000 years ago), an extinct paleospecies of argali (Ovis argaloides) lived also in Europe. Notable carnivores found across the whole range of the mammoth steppe included Panthera spelaea, the Wolverine, the wolf Canis lupus and the brown bear Ursus arctos. While the cave hyena was part of mammoth steppe faunas in Europe, it did not extend into the core high latitude north Asian range of the biome. Bird remains are rare because of their fragile structure, but there is some evidence for snowy owl, willow ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, common raven and great bustard. Other bird species are white-tailed eagle and golden eagle. Vultures like griffon vulture and cinereous vulture are not known but they were likely common scavengers on the mammoth steppe, following the large herds and scavenging on dead animals. On Wrangel Island, the remains of woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, bison and musk ox have been found. Reindeer and small animal remains do not preserve, but reindeer excrement has been found in sediment. Small animals on the mammoth steppe were, for example, steppe pika, ground squirrels and alpine marmot. In the most arid regions of the mammoth steppe that were to the south of Central Siberia and Mongolia, woolly rhinoceros were common but woolly mammoths were rare. Reindeer live in the far north of Mongolia today and historically their southern boundary passed through Germany and along the steppes of eastern Europe, indicating they once covered much of the mammoth steppe. \n\nParagraph 11: Steve Aoki first announced the album during an interview for EDM.com at the end of January 2019. According to him, it marks the continuation of Neon Future II and III that he wrote together. He announced that he was finishing Neon Future IV, which would contain \"mega collaborations\" and that he would release the following singles of the album one by one, before publishing the opus, which was originally planned to be unveiled in 2019. A few days after, he announced via Twitter that he was working for a song with American rapper Ty Dolla Sign, which will be included in Neon Future IV. The album availability date has been announced several months after the release of Neon Future III in November 2018, and two dates were defined, first in Spring 2019, then in September 2019. In June, during an interview for MusicTech, he confirmed that he was working on it and prevented that many new singles will be dropped in order to complement the upcoming album. During an interview for iHeartRadio about his song \"Let It Be Me\" released in September, Aoki said, \"Neon Future IV is packed with collabs. Every song is gonna be [a] very interesting, diverse collab list of artists from all different kinds of worlds — which is how I love to do Neon Future. It's all about connecting with artists from all different walks of life.\" In November, he premiered his album during All Nippon Airways Celebration in New York. A few moments before his performance, he said, \"It's a bit nerve wracking because I've never played it for anyone. Actually, some of these songs never heard the light of day outside my studio. So this is a big moment, and the moment's coming soon. The Neon Future IV album will be coming out soon, but people in this room tonight will be the first to ever hear what I've been working on for a long time.\" The DJ also confirmed that it will be released at the end of 2019, and then debuted a mix containing his previous tracks and seven unreleased songs – all of them are collaborations – which should appear in the album tracklist. Liz Kraker of EDM.com noted that they varied in subgenre with dance-pop, future bass, trap and moombahton. After the release of the track \"2 in a Million\" in December 2019, the album was announced for release in 2020.\n\nParagraph 12: Even though her mixed heritage made living on either Cardassia or Bajor unrealistic due to the inherent prejudices, she ended up spending time on Bajor attending a university there.  After living there for a short time, Ziyal moved to DS9 where she felt more comfortable and at ease among the station's diverse population, with the bonus of being closer to Major Kira whom she considered a big sister. She was also friends with Elim Garak and Julian Bashir. She briefly evacuated to Bajor after the Cardassian/Dominion troops reclaimed DS9 (Terok Nor) from the Federation but eventually returned to be near her father Gul Dukat and her close friend Kira Nerys. After she came to realize what type of man her father really was, she agreed to help Quark liberate Rom, Kira, Jake and Leeta from prison.  They had been imprisoned for attempting to sabotage the Cardassian/Dominion force's planned disarmament of the Federation minefield around the wormhole, which was preventing the Gamma quadrant's Dominion reinforcements from entering the Alpha Quadrant (Season 6 episode \"Sacrifice of Angels\"). While her father was attempting to convince her to flee the station and return to Cardassia with him before the Federation troops retook the station, she was killed by Gul Dukat's first officer Damar after he overheard her confession to her father about having helped free the New Resistance members. Dukat underwent an immediate and near catatonic mental breakdown after witnessing his daughter's death right before his eyes.\n\nParagraph 13: At the intersection of the Guerneville Bridge, the route turns southeast and passes through Forestville. River Road continues eastward as a country road towards Fulton and Santa Rosa. The section of SR 116 connecting Guerneville and Forestville is known as Pocket Canyon Road, named for the canyon it passes through. The four east-west blocks of Forestville through which 116 passes are called Front Street, but the route veers south again towards Graton and Sebastopol. Here it is called Gravenstein Highway North until the intersection with Covert Street in Sebastopol. There it undergoes another name change: Healdsburg Avenue. But it doesn't last long—heading south (right turn), it becomes North Main Street for two blocks where it intersects Bodega Highway SR 12), whereupon it becomes South Main Street. When the one-way street becomes a two-way street again, 116 is known as Gravenstein Highway South all the way to Cotati where it runs concurrently with U.S. Route 101 (US 101) as the Redwood Highway south to Petaluma. In Petaluma, Lakeville Highway takes SR 116 to Stage Gulch Road, which makes a left turn east toward Sonoma, crossing the Sonoma Mountains directly north of Tolay Lake and descending into the Sonoma Valley. In Sonoma, SR 116 runs along Arnold Drive to its terminus at SR 121 near Schellville.\n\nParagraph 14: On the other hand, philosophy has theology to thank for its unmistakable radiance. Modern philosophers like Kant, Hegel, and Schelling are unthinkable without a theological background, not to mention postmoderns, like Heidegger or Levinas. The necessity to pose philosophical questions and contemplate natural theology became a dominating concern for Christianity and Western philosophy. For Wierciński, hermeneutics thoughtfully pursues a degree of mediation between the two poles of opposed misunderstandings of religion and the secular world. Hermeneutics comes to the aid of a strained relationship like a middleman and becomes ever more conscious of the finitude and historicity of understanding. The divide between theology and philosophy in the Western tradition is simply not a problem that must be overcome. In fact, this divide gave rise to a fruitful legacy that provoked both philosophy and theology to pose hermeneutic questions. On the basis of hermeneutics, Wierciński invites a rejection of Heidegger’s call for a radical separation between philosophy and theology. Such a separation is hermeneutically untenable. Independently of how strictly the disciplines attempt to maintain their distance from one another, the opposing influence cannot be avoided. It is already a historical reality. Hermeneutics calls for new and renewed consideration of the problematic connections of theology and philosophy that needs to happen at different levels. Philosophy and theology are not simply static disciplines that must somehow become methodologically associated, but historical disciplines with their own distinctive intellectual histories. The hermeneutic-critical apparatus, narrative identity in particular, is necessary to reclaim, in a constructive articulation, the tradition of respect and connection between philosophy and theology. The space that is to be established anew between philosophy and theology thanks to the contemplation of the incommensurable is an invitation to hermeneutics. That which happens in the no-man’s land between the two disciplines is hermeneutics and can only be hermeneutics. It is a hermeneutics between the courage to inquire and the humility to listen. Wierciński claims no final judgment regarding the single proper connection of philosophy and theology but attempts rather to show another way, a way that is to negotiate between the two disciplines. The sole possibility of disclosing this way lies in actually practicing hermeneutics. The incommensurability of philosophy and theology yearns for a myriad of interpretations. Philosophy and theology cannot eliminate such an open space for the manifold of interpretations, not even with reference to the distance between the two. Neither can one forbid the other from understanding and interpreting their connection differently.\n\nParagraph 15: Although the Country Party cooperated with the Liberals in bringing down Scaddan's Labour government, they declined to form a coalition ministry, and they were inconsistent in their support of Wilson's government.  At one point in February 1917, a dispute between the parties prompted Wilson to tender his resignation, but this was refused by the governor.  At the same time, federal party politics was being transformed by the \"nationalist movement\", a reconstruction of the party system along the lines of the conscription debate.  There was some pressure on Wilson to form a Nationalist Party at the state level, and this pressure increased after Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party easily won the federal election of May 1917.  Later that month, Wilson called a meeting of Liberal, Country Party and National Labor members, and a Nationalist Party was formed.  However, in early June the members of the new party voted to reconstruct the ministry by caucus election.  Realising that the intention was to oust the current ministry, Wilson and three of his ministers walked out of the meeting.  Two weeks later, Henry Lefroy was elected leader of the party, leaving Wilson with no choice but to resign as premier.  He did so on 28 June 1917, and sat as an independent until the general elections of 29 September 1917, in which he lost his seat by a margin of four votes.\n\nParagraph 16: Amidst the divorce, Jackson began recording her seventh album. MTV News reported Jackson had nearly completed work on the \"upbeat, fun and carefree\" record, in contrast to the darker tone of her prior release. Producer Jimmy Jam stated, \"This record now, even though it may not be the best of times in her personal life, she feels that the future is bright... She's excited about music and about life in general. She's excited about what the next year will hold for her, and that's the tone she's set for herself and [the album].\" Jam added, \"In the history of Janet, the records that are the happy records, that make people smile, have always traditionally been the more successful records.. going back as far to songs like 'When I Think of You' to 'Doesn't Really Matter.' This continues that tradition, with kind of a nod to the dance music of the '80s.\" Virgin Records' president Roy Cooper stated, \"The new album is very bright, it's very upbeat and dynamic. She wanted to make an album that was rhythmically strong as well as melodically strong. She also wanted as explosive and strong a start as possible, and this certainly qualifies.\" Explaining its concept, Jackson said:\n\nParagraph 17: \"Oberland\", in this context, is a Hungarian-Jewish historiographic term, unrelated to the territory of Upper Hungary (Oberungarn, sometimes Oberland). Its origin lies in the immigration pattern of Jews into the country during the 18th century. Those arriving from Austria and Moravia settled in the adjacent counties of the northwest, mainly from Trencsén to Sopron, and gradually spread further; however, a large swath in the center of northern Hungary, between Szepes and Hajdú, remained closed for Jewish settlement until all residential limits were lifted in 1840. Thus, a demarcation line separated the Austrian and Moravian Jews from the Galician Jews, who emigrated to the northeastern territories. Those west of it were known as \"Oberlander\" (highlanders), and the Galicians were \"Unterlander Jews\" (lowlanders). In rabbinic sources written in Hebrew, it was translated as the Upper and Lower Provinces (Galil E'lion, Galil Takhton). The designation was coined by the former. After 1840, the geographical boundary dividing Oberland and Unterland was the linguistic one between Western Yiddish and Middle (\"Polish\") Yiddish: It stretched from the Tatra Mountains, between Poprád (present-day Poprad) and Liptószentmiklós (present-day Liptovský Mikuláš), Nagyszabos (present-day Slavošovce) and Rozsnyó (present-day Rožňava), continuing just north of Debrecen and south of Miskolc, until reaching the Hungarian border in Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca). While sometimes applied to all western Jews, like those in Budapest and beyond, it came to denote the Orthodox ones who resided in contemporary Slovakia, west of the boundary detailed above, and in contemporary Burgenland. Their ancestors arrived in two waves: The first, comprising Austrians, came after the expulsion of the Jews from Vienna in 1670. They were welcomed by Paul I, Prince Esterházy, who allowed them to settle in Burgenland and to form the Seven Communities on his lands. Another, much larger, wave entered Hungary in the wake of an Imperial decree from 1727, which limited the number of Jews allowed to marry in Moravia to 5,106. It remained in effect until 1848.\n\nParagraph 18: Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the album four stars out of five, saying that it was true that Changed is the most country project they've released in 10 years, and there are some new approaches on tracks like \"Sunrise\" and \"Let It Hurt\", on which he notes, \"The second verse of this dark, brooding ballad is brilliant, and LeVox goes somewhere deep to bring it to life.\" Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave it four stars out of five, saying, \"Changed represents the continuation of a new chapter for the trio in their career and while the songs on the album don't represent the \"change\" some critics and some fans may have hoped for, what they have done is provide their loyal set of fans and other country fans a strong, consistent album of radio-ready material and something that can compete with the bands chompin' at their feet to take their place as the #1 band in country music.\"\" Jessica Nicholson of Country Weekly gave the release three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that \"the album lacks some of the energy and freshness of 2010's Nothing Like This, but introspective tunes such as \"A Little Home,\" \"Sunrise\" and \"Come Wake Me Up\" add even more depth to the trio's sound.\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying the album \"errs on the side of caution\" and \"toned down the brightness\" from their prior release, but praised the consistency of the songs and the \"cool assured adult contemporary pulse of \"Hot in Here.\"\" Michael McCall of the Associated Press gave the album a positive review, saying that they sound wiser and more grounded, balancing grown-up, light country-rockers with ballads grounded in real life and the album proves they have moved forward in the most important of ways — with their music. Grace Duffy of the Under The Gun Review gave the album seven out of ten stars, saying that the album is an open and natural addition to Rascal Flatts’ repertoire. Meena Iyer of Musicperk gave the album eight-and-a-half out of ten stars, saying \"the album is a mixture of soulful music which can melt your heart and few fun upbeat tracks to make you dance.\" Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"the trio has streamlined its mix of pop and country in Changed.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave the album a positive review, saying \"on this album has largely taken to heart.\" Robert Silva of About.com gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"the new record puts the trio in more rootsy territory than their previous effort, Nothing Like This.\" Sarah Gibson of ukCOUNTRYmusic.NET gave the album nine out of ten stars, saying \"this album reflects the style we know and love from the group and not a \"changed\" style as the title suggests, and the album is reflective of their true country roots.\"\n\nParagraph 19: Critic Rajeev Masand rated the film 2/5, writing, \"Ki & Ka arrives with a curious premise, but Balki fails to flesh it out into an engaging film. I was especially pleased to see Kareena Kapoor sink her teeth into a solid role after what seems like an eternity. Arjun Kapoor deserves credit for taking a role that few male stars would, but both actors are let down by the inert writing.\" Anupama Chopra also rated it 2/5. She reasoned that \"One of the enduring problems with Balki's films persists – his crackling concept runs out of steam. It's almost as if he spends so much of his creative energy coming up with the high-wire idea that he has none left to flesh out the narrative around it.\" Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 stars out of 5, and stated, \"On the whole, Ki & Ka is a cleverly crafted feel-good film that packs all the emotions. Though it has strong performances by both Arjun and Kareena, the film is bound to draw extreme reactions from the orthodox audiences who may find the premise difficult to digest. It is an urban progressive film and should appeal more to women and young married couples.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2 stars and termed it as \"rocky\" while commenting that \"The film is fun when it is setting up the roles. But the execution, as it goes along, gets rocky. Much of it stays episodic, and starts reinforcing the very stereotypes it set out to negate. The problem is the film's unwillingness to go the mile. She also noted that it could have been more \"sharper\" and \"deeper\". Rohit Vats from Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 2.5 and noted that film has a lot of drama and summarized, \"There is no denying that Ki & Ka has a noble concept, but hasn't the director very conveniently confined himself to a comfort zone where he only needs to break some generalised stereotypes such as ‘women can't be ambitious’ or ‘men can't cook at home’ or ‘a woman's career is finished after pregnancy’? Ki & Ka isn't a strong voice against gender stereotyping, but it's one of its kind in mainstream Hindi film industry, and that makes it notice-worthy.\" Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the film 4 stars and stated, \"Kareena is terrific, Arjun, endearing. But Balki's writing is inconsistent. A few scenes leave you misty-eyed, but for the most part, the stock situations are banal. Yet, Ki and Ka is worth a ticket because it tells shows how there is nothing wrong with the man wearing the apron and the women wearing her ambition.\"\n\nParagraph 20: The story is about Eliza Wharton, the daughter of a clergyman. At the beginning of the novel she has just been released from an unwanted marriage by the death of her betrothed, the Rev. Haly, also a clergyman, whom Eliza nursed during his final days in her own home. After this experience, she decides she wants friendship and independence. After a short period of time living with friends, she is courted by two men. One, Boyer, is a respected but rather boring clergyman, whom all of her friends and her mother recommend she accept in marriage. The other, Sanford, is an aristocratic libertine, who has no intention to marry but determines not to let another man have Eliza. Because of her indecision and her apparent preference for the libertine Sanford, Boyer eventually gives up on her, deciding that she will not make a suitable wife. Sanford also disappears from her life and marries another woman, Nancy, for her fortune. Eliza eventually decides that she really loved Boyer and wants him back. Unfortunately for Eliza, Boyer has already decided to marry Maria Selby, a relation of Boyer's friend. Sanford later reappears married, but is able to seduce the depressed Eliza. They have a hidden affair for some time until, overcome by guilt and unwilling to face her family and friends, Eliza arranges to escape from her home. Like the real-life Elizabeth Whitman, she dies due to childbirth complications and is buried by strangers. Mrs. Wharton (Eliza's mother) and all of Eliza's friends are deeply saddened by her death. Sanford, too, is devastated by her death. In a letter to his friend, Charles Deighton, he expresses his regret at his wretched behavior.\n\nParagraph 21:  SV-81-Athe U.S. military's only career SERE Specialist Course is offered by the 66th TRS at the Air Force Survival School at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington and other regional locations. After a grueling selection process, successful students relocate to Fairchild, where they experience what they will teach by completing the SV-80-A course. Then they undertake a series of challenging field training exercises over a 5 month period to develop broad first-hand knowledge and experience in different terrains, weather, and situations (and differing gear). Those who graduate (less than 10%) are awarded the Sage Beret (with insignia pin), SERE Arch and SERE Flashonly to enter another 45 weeks of intensive on-the-job training. At some point, graduates must complete Airborne School. After completion of 3–4 years as a \"field instructor,\" specialists may be tasked to train students worldwide. USAF SERE specialists are encouraged to complete an associate degree in survival and rescue sciences through the USAF Community College to continue to advance in the SERE career field. (SERE Specialists complete additional qualification training at specialized schools as required. Examples are Scuba Courses, Military Freefall Parachuting, Altitude chamber, etc. Assignment to each of the outlying schools requires additional training by the SERE Specialist. Upon reporting to the new assignment, each SERE specialist must first complete that school's course (the same as an aircrew member), and then be trained by the school's cadre in the specialized subject matter (and carry crews under supervision) before the newly assigned specialist is \"qualified\" to teach without supervision. At Edwards AFB, USAF SERE specialists are tasked as \"test parachutists\" and required to perform multiple jumps on newly introduced / modified rescue systems, aircraft, and parachuting and / or ejection systems. This includes test parachuting newly designed canopies, harnesses, etc. Currently, they are the only test parachutists in the Department of Defense. USAF SERE specialists are considered DOD-wide subject matter experts in their field and are assigned to base level and command staff as advisers).\n\nParagraph 22: It was founded in 1894 with a bequest by Henry James Campbell, who made his fortune in the linen trade, and left money to found a school based on the values of a Liberal Protestant education. Initially the school was primarily a boarding school but it has, particularly since the 1970s, become primarily a day school; in 2009 it had 879 pupils, only about 85 (10%) of whom were boarders. As a selective independent school, it admits pupils based on academic selection. Until 2006 pupils began at the school at age 11, but since the closure of the school's separate preparatory school, Cabin Hill, the school has accepted pupils from age 4 into the newly built Junior School, and both boys and girls into the school's kindergarten located on the school's grounds. The Latin motto of the school is Ne Obliviscaris (\"Do Not Forget\").\n\nParagraph 23: Following his tenure in ROH, Mack returned to JAPW on September 10, 2005 with a win over Bandito, Jr. Upon finishing up 2005 and entering 2006, Mack competed in several singles matches and started a feud with Trent Acid, as well as forming a tag team called the Heavy Hitters with new partner Havoc. On July 29, 2006, Mack won a battle royal to earn a title match against then-Heavyweight Champion Rhino. However, Mack was unsuccessful in winning the title belt after he was pinned by Rhino following a Gore through a wooden door. On September 15, Mack was granted a rematch against Rhino for the title, but he once again lost. In 2007, Mack took the summer off to rest and recuperate a knee injury before returning to the ring on July 21, 2007 with a victory alongside Havoc after they beat Wes Draven and Pinkie Sanchez. The Heavy Hitters then began a winning streak throughout the end of 2007 and into 2008, defeating several teams such as The Christopher Street Connection and The Gemini Twins en route to becoming contenders for the Tag Team Championship. On May 31, 2008, the Heavy Hitters were unable to win the title from then-champions The Latin American Xchange. The Hitters rebounded with a victory on August 16 over The Nigerian Nightmares and again faced LAX for the title one month later, but were again unable to win. After their second title match loss, the Hitters again defeated The Nigerian Nightmares before going undefeated once again throughout the rest of 2008 and into early 2009. On June 27, the Hitters lost a four-way match to The Garden State Gods (Corvis Fear and Myke Quest), also involving the Voodoo Kin Mafia and DNA (Sonjay Dutt and Azrieal), for the Tag Team Title. On January 23, 2010, the Heavy Hitters defeated The H8 Club (Nick Gage and Nate Hatred) and the Tag Team Champions The Hillbilly Wrecking Crew (Necro Butcher and Brodie Lee) to win the Tag Team Title. As a result of the win, Mack tied the record with Homicide for the most reigns as Tag Team Champion. Mack and Havok lost the titles on October 23, 2010, to Sami Callihan and Chris Dickinson in a three-way match, which also included Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney. On December 10 Mack and Dan Maff won the titles from Callihan and Dickinson, marking the start of Mack's record breaking seventh JAPW Tag Team Championship reign. The two would, however, lose the titles to Necro Butcher and Nick Gage the next day.\n\nParagraph 24: The fourth and final season, 2008–09, started with the Roadrunners facing off against their rivals the Victoria Salmon Kings, with the three game series going two-of-three to the Runners. October ended with the team going 3-2-1 giving the team seven of a possible twelve points on the month. November ended with the team going 5-8-1, giving them 11 of a possible 28 points, bringing the team to fourth in their division. In December the team rallied around the outstanding goaltending of Craig Kowalski and won two consecutive contests at home against the team's rival Las Vegas Wranglers. The two game performance by Kowalski earned him the ECHL Goalie of the Week award, becoming the first Roadrunners Goalie since Cody Rudkowsky in 2006 to win the award. The team also saw Mike Fornataro and Michael Wilson go to the ECHL All-Star Game in January. The team finished the month going 4-6-0 and gave the team eight of a possible 20 points, and staying at fourth in their division. The team finished January with a 5-6-0 record, winning 10 of a possible 22 points. However, a series near the end of the season against the Alaska Aces did not go well, as they were outscored 18-5 throughout the series, and were swept, dashing the Roadrunners' playoff hopes.\n\nParagraph 25: In American administrative law, ALJs are Article I judges under the U.S. Constitution. As such, they do not exercise full judicial power, essentially, the power over life, liberty, and property. Article I (legislative) judges and courts are not constrained to rendering opinions for only a \"case or controversy\" before them and may render advisory opinions on a purely prospective basis, such as, e.g., Congressional reference cases assigned to the Court of Federal Claims. Agency ALJs do not have the power to offer such advisory opinions, as it would be in violation of the power afforded them under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §557. Unlike the agency, ALJs are not policy or rule makers.\n\nParagraph 26: The nearly level interior of Mendeleev contains a number of smaller crater formations which have been given names. These form a rough pentagon formation that covers much of the interior floor. Along the western inner floor, the craters Bergman to the west-northwest and Moissan to the west just make contact with the western inner wall of Mendeleev. Together with Bergman, Fischer to the north-northeast and Richards in the north of Mendeleev form the northern side of the pentagon. The figure continues with Harden near Schuster, and Benedict just to the southeast of the midpoint of Mendeleev. The largest crater within the Mendeleev basin is Mendeleev P, to the south-southwest.\n\nParagraph 27: Another of the one-off projects funded by the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation was the re-design of the Touring Exhibitions Group's website. Keeping a numerous and dispersed membership informed about the policies and activities of the committee that was working on its behalf is a challenge for any organisation. For one with limited resources, communication was difficult because of the cost of producing and mailing regular newsletters. There is the opportunity at Annual General Meetings for members to question and challenge the outgoing committee on its achievements and failures, but an AGM is retrospective, only once a year and attended by a small proportion of the membership. A more continuous, two-way interaction between the Committee and the membership is now possible, thanks to the explosive development of the internet, which has had a profound impact on the way that TEG functions. As late as 1997, the exchange of drafts by email was thought worthy of mention in that year's annual report, not just for its speed and economy but also because the drafts were tested in a wider consultation with those members who had e-mail addresses (by no means a universal condition in 1997). Ten years later, monthly e-newsletters, simple and inexpensive to produce and distribute, provided a regular channel of information to the membership. TEG's first website went on-line in 1999. It was written on a shoestring, with help in kind from Panelock. Like all first websites, it was tentative and experimental, testing what such a site should provide and how it might be done, with new features added as and when the need was recognised. By 2003, this structure (with its superstructure of add-ons) was creaking at the seams, so a radical overhaul and redesign by the website designers, Red Leader Industries, became one of the stand-alone projects funded by EFF. This second website gives members easy access to news and resources. At the most formal level, minutes from committee meetings are posted on the website so that members are able to follow the work of the Committee and - if they feel moved to - provide comment and influence policy. At a different level, the website includes a database which allows members to use different criteria (subject, period, size, etc.) to search for exhibitions available for hire. In the event, this database proved to be so effective – simple to use and with immediate results - that it made the publication ‘X’ wholly redundant, and it has now been replaced by a twice-yearly magazine, Exchange, explicitly a marketing aid for TEG events.\n\nParagraph 28: In the Anti-Federalist papers, the authors wrote about their concern about giving more power to the Federal Government. \"Centinel feared not only a standing army but the abuse of local militias by the national government.\"(Paul Finkelman, Complete Anti-Federalist, scholarship.law.cornell.edu). When it came to the militias, one author writing under the pseudonym \"Centinel\" felt that the militias were just another tool the general government had to use however they pleased. Other authors, such as Maryland's Luther Martin, similarly questioned federal control over the state militias. Martin feared that congressional authority over the militias meant that \"the only defence and protection which the state can have for the security of their rights against arbitrary encroachments of the general government, is taken entirely out of the power of their respective States, and placed under the power of Congress.\"(Paul Finkelman, Complete Anti-Federalist, scholarship.law.cornell.edu). Martin went on to show his concerns about the power the federal government would have by saying the states are left basically useless and could easily become \"slaves\" to the national government. Despite having militias in each state, the federal government still had power over the militias. Alexander Hamilton understood the opposition to the Federalist views on Militias. The extensive control by the federal government was worrisome to those who opposed this essay. \"...What reason could there be to infer, that force was intended to be the sole instrument of authority, merely because there is a power to make use of it when necessary?\"(James Madison, John Jay, The Federalist, books.google.com). He mentions the possibility of forming corps with young soldiers who are willing for their country. \"... The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as will really fit them for service in case of need\"(James Madison, John Jay, The Federalist, books.google.com). Hamilton wrote that the militia would be composed of soldiers who would not just protect and serve their country but ensure that it does not become corrupt. He also mentioned in his essay that some people see this idea as unrealistic. \"There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery ...  Where, in the name of common-sense, are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our brothers, our neighbors, our fellow citizens?\"(James Madison, John Jay, The Federalist, books.google.com). Hamilton argues to critics who doubt that the militia would be trusted that they forget militia is made up of the people the average citizen would know and trust.\n\nParagraph 29: In 2006 plans were announced for the renovation of the college as new administrative headquarters for the Council to replace the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street. The University leased the Marischal College site to Aberdeen City Council for 175 years in exchange for £4.7 million. Work began in 2009 and the newly refurbished Marischal College was opened in summer 2011. The derelict internal spaces were completely demolished and replaced with a new internal structure which matched exactly to the existing walls and windows.  The renovations restored the granite exterior, ornamentation and detailing to their original glory, and provided new public space for citizens accessing council services and state-of-the-art offices for council workers. The Council Chamber and democratic processes continue to be located at the Town House next door. The university retained the north wing comprising the Mitchell Hall, debating chamber and associated rooms, although as of May 2012 these are not yet open for use. In Spring 2011, the city erected outside Marischal College a statue of King Robert the Bruce on horseback, holding up a charter. Outside the College there is a large modern fountain, known as the \"dancing fountain\" for its alternating patterns. The fountain was briefly shut in 2019 due to high levels of bromine, but has since been turned back on.\n\nParagraph 30: On 29 April, COMUSMACV General William  Westmoreland ordered the 1st Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Salve H. Matheson to immediately join Task Force Oregon in I Corps. In early May the brigade put ashore at Razorback Beach in southern Quảng Ngai, established a base named Carentan, and prepared for action against the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN)/Viet Cong (VC)'s inland base areas-numbered 122, 123 and 124 which ran from north to south through the mountainous jungle overlooking the Ve and Tra Cau River Valleys. On 11 May, the 1st Brigade moved into the interior looking for the 1st and 2nd Regiments, both of which were thought to lurk there. Two of the three battalions conducted air assaults into the western part of Base Area 124, a tangle of tree-clad low hills overlooking the coastal plain. Resistance was light. The next morning Matheson committed his remaining battalion to a blocking position on high ground in the eastern part of the base area and ordered the other two battalions to sweep toward it. Encountering little opposition in the days that followed, Matheson decentralized his operations and conducted a more rigorous search. Matheson allowed each battalion commander to work his operational area as he saw fit, insisting only that companies operate within a two-hour march of each other. Most units kept constantly on the move and traveled with three to five days' worth of supplies, so the PAVN/VC would be less likely to pinpoint their location by observing resupply helicopters. Companies split into platoons for wider coverage of a search area, but remained close enough to reassemble quickly if they ran into a sizable force. These tactics often paid off. On 13 May, near the Tra Cau's headwaters, 12 separate firefights occurred, the largest against an entrenched VC company. By nightfall, the Americans had killed 29 VC at a cost of 1 American killed and 7 wounded, but the outcome was not always so one-sided. On 18 May Company B, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, moved well inside a large VC camp before realizing that the occupants had not yet fled. Confusion reigned during the firefight, and the Americans realized they were too close to their enemy to call in artillery or helicopter gunships. For six hours they fought, sometimes hand to hand, until reinforcements arrived and the VC pulled back. Left on the battlefield were 31 VC dead, while American casualties were 12 killed and 41 wounded. Matheson's men completed their scouring of Base Area 124 in early June, reporting that they had killed or captured over 400 VC, seized 125 weapons, and razed several base camps.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text discusses the conflict between the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO) and the District 26, United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) union in the Sydney coalfield. BESCO took over the DOMCO mines in 1920 and aimed to break the union. After many small strikes, a major strike occurred in 1925 when BESCO refused to negotiate with the union. The strike lasted from March to August, with miners picketing and causing disruptions at BESCO facilities. Tensions escalated on June 11, 1925, when company police clashed with striking miners, resulting in the death of one miner named Davis. This incident led to further clashes and attacks on company properties. The escalating violence led to the deployment of the provincial police force and Canadian Army to control the situation. Eventually, BESCO accepted government intervention and settled the strike. However, the labor activism in Industrial Cape Breton continued. BESCO was later merged into a larger corporation called the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

On 5 October 2008 Ex Tempore hosted the Mahmoud Darwish memorial lecture during which poems of the Palestinian poet were read out in Arabic, English and French. On 25 January 2013 UNSW held its 17th annual salon, attended by 65 UN writers. On 24 January 2014 the 18th annual salon was held, attended by 62 UN staffers, on 23 January 2015 the 19th salon, on 22 January 2016 the 20th salon, on 20 January 2017 the 21st salon; the 22nd salon on 26 January 2018.  The 23rd salon is scheduled on 25 January 2019.   On 27 September 2019 the United Nations Library celebrated an event \"Express and De-Stress\" to commemorate 30 years of the UNSW and 30 years of publishing its literary journal Ex Tempore.  The 24th salon was held on 24 January 2020 with 48 in the audience and 15 readers in English, French, German, Latin, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese.\n\nParagraph 2: The second agent is Ray Nadeem (Jay Ali), a down on his luck agent in the New York office who has been a pawn of Fisk's for three years without even knowing him. Fisk cuts off his sister-in-law's medical insurance, forcing Nadeem to pay her medical bills and go into crippling debt, ruining his FICO score and delaying hopes of career advancement. When Nadeem visits Fisk in prison and Fisk informs on the Albanians to him, Nadeem readily accepts Fisk's information and his terms of relocation without considering the repercussions. Fisk takes advantage of Nadeem's pride to manipulate him into going after the members of Nelson & Murdock for ostensibly doing Fisk's dirty work. While he eventually realizes he's been played after Jasper Evans' death, it is too late for him to back out and he ends up being blackmailed by his boss Tammy Hattley (Kate Udall) into working with Dex to enforce Fisk's protection tax, and serves as a getaway driver during Dex's attempt on Karen. A conversation with Matt's mother Sister Maggie (Joanne Whalley) convinces Nadeem to grow a spine and stand up to Dex, by arranging with Foggy Nelson and Detective Brett Mahoney for Karen to be \"apprehended\" by the NYPD. Fisk attempts to kill Nadeem and his family right away, but Matt and Foggy rescue him and convince him to testify before a grand jury convened by District Attorney Blake Tower. Fisk foils their efforts by intimidating the grand jury. Nadeem flees back home and makes a video confession to everything he's witnessed before Dex shows up at his house to murder him on Vanessa's orders. The video, as his dying declaration, is considered thanks to a legal loophole to be credible evidence that allows the NYPD to arrest Fisk and put him back in prison.\n\nParagraph 3: Wild horses have lived in Britain for hundreds of thousands of years. Some remains found date as early as 700,000 BC, while others are as recent as 3,500 BC. No genetic studies to date have correlated these prehistoric remains to any modern breed. What has been studied are Y-chromosomes (Y-DNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The Y-chromosome is passed on through the male line, and worldwide shows very little genetic variation in horses, except for a second Y-chromosome haplotype found in China, suggesting that a very limited number of stallions contributed to the original genome of the domestic horse. The Exmoor pony shares this general Y-chromosome haplotype. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA is passed on though the female line, and shows far more variation than Y-DNA, indicating that a large number of wild mares from several regions have contributed to modern domestic breeds. Some mtDNA-haplotypes have been found in DNA samples obtained from wild horses in prehistoric deposits, while other mtDNA-haplotypes have only been found in domesticated horses, from both living individuals and archeological finds. The Exmoor pony has a high frequency of pre-domestication mtDNA-haplotypes; these are also found in some other breeds all around the world. Currently, for the British Isles, few DNA archeological samples have been studied.\n\nParagraph 4: Combat boots are military boots designed to be worn by soldiers during combat or combat training, as opposed to during parades and other ceremonial duties. Modern combat boots are designed to provide a combination of grip, ankle stability, and foot protection suitable for a rugged environment. They are traditionally made of hardened and sometimes waterproofed leather. Today, many combat boots incorporate technologies originating in civilian hiking boots, such as Gore-Tex nylon side panels, which improve ventilation and comfort. They are also often specialized for certain climates and conditions, such as jungle boots, desert boots, and cold weather boots as well as specific uses, such as tanker boots and jump boots.\n\nParagraph 5: Acoli was radicalised by the assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968 and that same year joined the Harlem chapter of the Black Panther Party as its finance minister. He was arrested on April 2, 1969, in the Panther 21 conspiracy case, in which members were accused of planned coordinated bombing and long-range rifle attack on two police stations and an education office in New York City. A group called Computer People for Peace raised $50,000 bail for him but it was rejected by the judge. Acoli and the other defendants were ultimately acquitted of all charges in that case.\n\nParagraph 6: He was less than happy when an amazed McQueen discovered his past and asked, \"How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?\" Hudson bitterly admitted that he did not quit, but was forced into retirement after his crash by the rise of hot young racers. \"There was a lot left in me,\" Hudson said sadly, \"I never got the chance to show them.\" After McQueen finished fixing the Radiator Springs road that he damaged when arriving in town as part of Hudson's court ruling, McQueen decided to stay in town for one extra day, but Hudson was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the news and press, prompting McQueen to immediately leave for the Piston Cup championship race in California. After being scolded by Sally for revealing McQueen's location and making him leave out of his dislike of him, Hudson realizes that McQueen became more important to them than he thought since he helped them restore the town to its former glory just as they had helped him change his ways and began to regret his actions; he believed the town would be happier without McQueen, but was proven wrong. Eventually, he not only admitted to the townsfolk that he was the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, but took back his #51 racing colors to become McQueen's pit crew chief. Nearly the entire town travelled to California as McQueen's pit crew and cheering section. At the race, the commentators recognized his presence on the cameras and Hudson finally received a long-overdue acknowledgment for his return. During the final lap of the race, McQueen uses an old trick he learned from Hudson, which immediately puts a smile on Hudson's face and it shows he truly learned something from him, to take the lead. When McQueen chose to help an injured Strip Weathers (whom he did not want to suffer the same misfortune Hudson did) finish his last race instead of winning the Piston Cup, which is won by an egotistical Chick Hicks (who ends up being pelted and stoned by the media and fans for what he did to Weathers as well as cheating), he smiled once more and expressed how proud he was of McQueen for doing what's right rather than what's important to him.\n\nParagraph 7: All four upper secondary schools are bilingual and about one fourth of the tuition is given in English by native speakers. This also means that course materials are both in Swedish and English. The schools have students attending from all over the greater Stockholm region, making admission highly competitive. VRG Odenplan has some of the highest minimum admission requirements in the country. Admission to its natural sciences program with natural sciences orientation is especially competitive; in 2009 all students had perfect grades, and since 2016 all students has had a score of at least 330.0 (with a national average of 228.7; out of maximum possible 340.0) translated from their grades from Swedish primary school, due to high application rates.\n\nParagraph 8: The next day Chief Narbona came to Canyon de Chelly for a \"talk peace\", along with several other headmen. In the treaty the Navajo acknowledged the jurisdiction of the United States and allowed forts and trading posts in Navajo land. The United States, on its part promised \"such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper\". After reaching an accord, a scuffle broke out when a New Mexican thought he saw his stolen horse and tried to claim it from the Navajo. (The Navajo held that the horse had passed through several owners by this time, and rightfully belonged to its Navajo owner). Washington sided with the New Mexican. Since the Navajo owner took his horse and fled the scene, Washington told the New Mexican to pick out any Navajo horse he wanted. The rest of the Navajo also left. At this, Col. Washington ordered his soldiers to fire. Seven Navajo were killed in the volleys; the rest ran and could not be caught. One of the dying was Chief Narbona, who was scalped as he lay dying by a New Mexican souvenir hunter. This massacre prompted the warlike Navajo leaders such as Manuelito to gain influence over those who were advocates of peace.\n\nParagraph 9: A skilled commander, with a strong army fortified by war elephants (which the Romans were not experienced in facing), Pyrrhus enjoyed initial success against the Roman legions, but suffered heavy losses even in these victories. Plutarch wrote that Pyrrhus said after the second battle of the war, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.\" He could not call up more men from home and his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent. The Romans, by contrast, had a very large pool of military manpower and could replenish their legions even if their forces were depleted in many battles. This has led to the expression \"Pyrrhic victory\", a term for a victory that inflicts losses the victor cannot afford in the long term.\n\nParagraph 10: The German Bettina Hoy was initially awarded first place.  During the first jumping phase, she received 14 time penalty points in an otherwise flawless round.  This put her in eighth place going into the final phase.  The Germans appealed those points, noting that the time on which the points had been assigned (the time from when Hoy had first crossed the starting line) was not the same time as the time displayed on the stadium clock and which Hoy had thought was the official time.  The clock had been reset and displayed the time from when Hoy had crossed the starting line the second time, which was when she began her jumps.  These points were then rescinded by the Jury of Appeal, which put Hoy in second place only 2.20 points behind the then-leader.  In the final jumping phase, Hoy moved into first place and was awarded the gold medal on 18 August.  The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on 21 August that the appeal had been incorrectly upheld and ordered that the 14 points be returned to Hoy's score.  This stripped her of her medal and put her in ninth place.\n\nParagraph 11: In Akita Prefecture, authorities reported that twelve houses were damaged in Akita City while eight homes were damaged in Yokote, and there were two landslides. Passing over Shizuoka Prefecture with most of its former intensity, 8 roads were closed and 28 homes were damaged. A total of  of rice as well as  of vegetables were damaged, along with three agricultural facilities. Damage was estimated at 243.1 million yen ($1.68 million USD), but the extent was limited by the storm's fast forward motion. A 54-year-old hotel owner broke a rib when gusty winds toppled a seaside structure in Shizuoka. In Fukushima Prefecture, seven homes were damaged in four towns, thirty-nine roads were closed, of which two were national highways. A total of 1,350 households lost power, and power lines downed several trees. The towns of Nakakura and Yazukado suffered flooding. One person was killed in Toyama Prefecture. A landslide closed two roads in Kmoagane in Nagano Prefecture. Throughout the prefecture, 18 dwellings sustained damage and 68 trains were cancelled or delayed, resulting in 49,000 stranded travelers. In Tochigi Prefecture, 141 houses, 266 roads, 284 communication lines, and 6 bridges received damage, while 10 homes were damaged and 23 landslides occurred. River embankments were breached in 710 locations while  of arable land was damaged, totaling 89.5 million yen ($617,000 USD). Damage there totaled to 1.32 billion yen ($9.1 million USD) and one person was hurt. In Gunma Prefecture, 26 structures, 35 roads, and  of farmland were damaged. Prefecturewide, Winona inflicted 390.8 million yen ($2.7 million USD) in damage. Along coastal areas of Saitama Prefecture, 60 houses were damaged,  of crops were damaged, 30 traffic accidents occurred, and five landslides were reported. In Ibaraki Prefecture, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, which resulted in four downed power lines, while one individual was injured. Damage in Yamanashi Prefecture totaled 6.62 billion yen ($45.7 million USD), including 4.80 billion yen ($33.1 million USD) in property damage. To the southeast of Tokyo, in Chiba Prefecture, 35 dwellings were damaged, and damage amounted to 3 million yen ($20,000 USD). Two people were hurt, a 56-year-old fractured his leg and a 78-year-old female fell due to strong winds, six embankments were breached, and thirty-two roads sustained damage. In Shizuoka Prefecture, the prefecture where the storm moved onshore, the heavy rainfall damaged 541 homes, destroyed 55 others, and triggered 13 landslides, which resulted in 12 damaged roads and 21 people homeless. The capital city of Tokyo was lashed with strong winds and heavy rain for several hours, with damage estimated at 34.9 million yen ($241,000 USD). Seven reservoirs in Tokyo received more than  of water; the reservoirs reached 36% capacity, which prompted officials to lift restrictions on water use that were enacted following a drought. Ten homes were flooded and damage totaled 128.5 million yen ($886,000 USD) in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven people were wounded, mostly due to gusty winds. The cyclone forced the first two days of the Karuizawa 72 Tokyu Ladies Open to be shortened.\n\nParagraph 12: Originally the area was called Kelly Bay in honour of its first settler, James Kelly, who lived as a hermit. In 1874, Oblate missionary Joseph Moffet (1852–1932) cleared some land and moved to Kelly Bay that came to be known as Baie-des-Pères (Bay of Fathers). In 1883, he was joined by a group of settlers from Nicolet. In 1886, the Parish of Notre-Dame-du-Saint-Rosaire-de-Ville-Marie was founded, and in 1891, the Baie-des-Père Post Office opened. The Village Municipality of Ville-Marie was incorporated in 1897 and the following year the post office was renamed to match the village's name. In 1899, the HBC post closed.\n\nParagraph 13: In 1364, Kirschroth had its first documentary mention as Rodde. It is certain, though, that it had already existed for quite some time, likely having arisen in the Early Middle Ages. Traces of human habitation may indeed stretch all the way back to Celtic and Roman times. The village was held by the Archbishops of Mainz well into the 12th century before being pledged to the Counts of Saarbrücken, and then about 1275 to the Waldgraves at the Kirburg. They then held it until the French Revolution in 1789. It was administered by a Schultheiß from Mainz who was subject to the castle count at Disibodenberg, or as of 1240  in Sobernheim and as of 1279 at Castle Böckelheim. In 1239, there was a serious dispute between the Archbishop and the counts in the Nahe area who opposed the ecclesiastical prince's quest for power in what they considered their domain. The local lordship over Kirschroth changed many times within the Waldgravial – and beginning in 1408 Waldgravial-Rhinegravial – family, because individual lines sometimes died out, arising from which were complicated divisions of inheritance. Until the 20th century, agriculture was the foremost income earner, and after that, winegrowing. In 1798, the French, to whom the Nahe area had finally fallen, set up their own Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Meddersheim, which comprised the villages of Meddersheim, Kirschroth and Staudernheim. After the French had been driven out and Napoleon had been definitively defeated, there came a short transitional time, this mairie, now called a Bürgermeisterei (meaning the same thing in German) passed under the terms of the Congress of Vienna to the new Oberamt of Meisenheim within the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg, passing once again along with this in 1866 to the Grand Dukes of Hesse-Darmstadt. They lost the Oberamt to the Kingdom of Prussia, which in 1869 made a small rural district out of it. In 1919, the Amt of Meddersheim was formed out of the Bürgermeistereien of Meddersheim and Merxheim, but this was dissolved along with the Meisenheim district in 1932. Beginning in 1935, Kirschroth was in a kind of “personal union” with the town of Sobernheim, and as of 1940, it was fully joined with it in a new Amt called Sobernheim. In 1969, the Amt of Sobernheim became the Verbandsgemeinde of Sobernheim. In 1990, Kirschroth placed third at the state level in the contest Unser Dorf soll schöner werden (“Our village should become lovelier”).\n\nParagraph 14: Harold Charles Schonberg was born in Washington Heights, Manhattan in New York City, New York on 29 November 1915. His parents were David and Minnie (Kirsch) Schonberg, and he had a brother (Stanley) and a sister (Edith). His aunt, Alice Frisca was an early influence and his first music teacher; she was a former concert pianist, and had studied with Leopold Godowsky. He started piano lessons with Frisca at four years old, and \"discovered early on that he had a superb musical memory that allowed him to remember pieces in great detail after a single hearing\". Schonberg himself cited the first performance he saw at the Metropolitan Opera around age 12 as particularly formative to his musical upbringing. A performance of Richard Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg with the conductor Artur Bodanzky, he would later write on the experience 39 years later, reflecting on the opera's opening chord that it \"rose to the dress circle, and he felt as though he could reach out, touch it, caress it. He had been to concerts before, but somehow, in this vast dark auditorium, there was a different feeling to the texture and even the organization of this chord. It sounded warm and cozy. It covered him like a blanket.\" In his recounting of the event, Schonberg claimed the experience as having inaugurated his desire to be a music critic. \n\nParagraph 15: The 1976 season began with the Panthers ranked ninth in the AP preseason poll. The first game was at Notre Dame, where the Irish grew the grass long on the playing field in a failed attempt to slow down Dorsett, who had burned them for 303 rushing yards the year before. Their efforts were in vain as Dorsett ran for a 61-yard touchdown on Pitt's first play from scrimmage on the way to a 31–10 win. The season continued with a 42–14 win at Georgia Tech and a 36–19 win over Miami. On October 23, the Panthers travelled to Annapolis to face Navy during which Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing record on a 32-yard touchdown run in Pitt's 45–0 victory. Dorsett's achievement prompted a mid-game celebration in which even Navy saluted the feat with a cannon blast. Pitt next defeated eastern rival Syracuse 23–13, and on November 6, number two ranked Pitt easily handled Army while number one ranked Michigan lost to Purdue. For the first time since 1939, the Pitt Panthers were the number one ranked team in the country. The following week, they successfully defended their top rating in a close Backyard Brawl against rival West Virginia. With a record of 10–0, the Panthers headed into their regular season finale with only heated instate rival Penn State standing in the way of Pitt's national title aspirations. At a packed Three Rivers Stadium on the day after Thanksgiving, the Nittany Lions held Dorsett to 51 yards in the first half and had the game tied 7-7. Majors adjusted for the second half by shifting Dorsett from tailback to fullback, enabling him to explode for an additional 173 yards as Pitt rolled to a 24–7 victory that capped an undefeated regular season. In December, Dorsett became the first Pitt Panther to win the Heisman Trophy as the nation's best college football player. Dorsett also won the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award, and was named UPI Player of the Year. The 11-0 Panthers accepted an invitation to the 1977 Sugar Bowl to face second ranked Georgia. Pitt defeated the Bulldogs 27-3 and was voted number one in both the final Associated Press and Coaches polls, claiming their ninth national championship. This was Pitt's first undefeated national championship since 1937. The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) named Majors the 1976 Coach of the Year. Following this historic season, Majors returned to his alma mater, the University of Tennessee, to take the head coaching job.\n\nParagraph 16: At the Royal Rumble, AJ Styles defeated Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn in a handicap match to retain the WWE Championship, although Owens, who was pinned, was not the legal man. On the following episode of SmackDown, Owens and Zayn interrupted 2018 Men's Royal Rumble winner Shinsuke Nakamura and said that they should be the co-WWE Champions, but the referee failed at his job. Styles and Nakamura then teamed up and defeated Owens and Zayn. During the match, there were tensions between Owens and Zayn as a result of General Manager Daniel Bryan scheduling them to face each other the following week to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship at Fastlane. Their match ended in a double disqualification, however, as Styles was provoked by Zayn and attacked both men, leading to Bryan scheduling a triple threat match between the three for the title. Commissioner Shane McMahon then announced on Twitter that the winner of a match between Dolph Ziggler and Baron Corbin the following week would be added to the championship match to make it a fatal four-way. Before that match started, Owens and Zayn attacked Corbin in the backstage area and later went after Ziggler to prevent either from being added. In response, Shane scheduled Owens to face Corbin and Zayn to face Ziggler, with both Corbin and Ziggler being added if they won their respective matches, while also threatening that if Owens or Zayn interfered in the other's match, that person would be removed from the title match. Corbin and Ziggler won their respective matches, thus making it a fatal five-way for the WWE Championship at Fastlane. On the February 27 episode, free agent John Cena, who was unsuccessful in becoming the number one contender for Raw's Universal Championship at Elimination Chamber two nights prior, made his return to SmackDown, determined to earn a match at WrestleMania 34. Bryan gave him the opportunity to be added to the WWE Championship match at Fastlane if he could defeat Styles in a non-title match. Cena defeated Styles, turning the championship match into a six-pack challenge. A brawl then ensued between all six competitors. To keep himself from being interrupted, Cena used his free agent status and appeared on the March 5 episode of Raw and said that he would break his and Ric Flair's tied record and become a 17-time world champion, and said that Styles should use his rematch clause to make the WWE Championship match at WrestleMania a triple threat match with Nakamura. On the final SmackDown before the pay-per-view, Owens and Zayn caused a double disqualification in a match between Styles and Ziggler; a five-way match with the addition of Corbin was scheduled, which saw Zayn score the win by turning on and pinning Owens.\n\nParagraph 17: The NROOGD Tradition of the Craft originated in 1967 with a group of friends (including e.l.f. Silverlocke, Glen Turner, Judy Greenwood, and Aidan Kelly). e.l.f. Silverlocke was taking a class at San Francisco State College, which gave her the assignment of creating and leading a ritual. She came up with the idea of recreating a Witches' Sabbath, using published sources from Robert Graves, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, a ritual was composed that has served as the basis of NROOGD practice ever since. After repeat performances of this rite yielded results on a number of occasions, a decision was made to create a group identity and train others in its performance.\n\nParagraph 18: A weak circulation developed along the axis of a trough situated offshore North Carolina in early September, with a tropical depression forming on September 3. The depression moved southward and likely dissipated by the next day. An inverted trough and a tropical wave merged and briefly developed into a tropical depression well offshore Georgia on September 11. By the next day, the circulation had either dissipated or merged with a cold front. A strong tropical wave developed into a tropical depression between the Cape Verde Islands and Senegal on September 21. Moving generally westward, the depression was last noted between the islands of Fogo and Santiago on September 22. The latter island observed sustained winds of . On October 2, a tropical depression likely formed over the eastern Gulf of Mexico about  south of Panama City, Florida. The depression continued westward and may have made landfall in Texas just north of Corpus Christi on October 5. However, there is no evidence of a closed circulation beyond October 3. A tropical depression – possibly subtropical – formed on October 28 over the central Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved northward and made landfall near the Alabama–Mississippi state line on October 31 and quickly dissipated. Pensacola, Florida, recorded a 5-minute wind gust of . The depression dropped mostly light rainfall in the area, with 24-hour amounts ranging from .\n\nParagraph 19: In the summer of 1915, after attending officer training camp in Plattsburgh, New York, for a proposed volunteer army (an outgrowth of the movement to prepare the United States for entry into World War I) and earning a commendation as a marksman, Heidelberger traveled to Lake Kezar in Maine for a vacation. After performing Pergolese's Nina there, his piano accompanist exclaimed, \"meet Nina,\" and in walked a young lady, Nina Tachau. They were married in 1916 to the strains of a wedding march composed by Heidelberger. She was a writer and activist for the New York chapter of the League of Women Voters and, during the 1940s, for the American Association for the United Nations. After her death from cancer in 1946, Heidelberger continued her work on behalf of the United Nations, and was a member of the U.S. delegation to meetings of the World Federation of United Nations Organizations in Prague, Bangkok, and other cities. He met his second wife Charlotte Rosen at a concert. She was the violist in a Mozart trio in which Heidelberger performed. They married in 1956. For ten years prior to her death in 1988, he took care of her at home while she suffered from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParagraph 20: According to the content there are basically three forms of FDI: establishing new branch, acquiring control share of an existing firm, and participating jointly in a domestic firm. As Albanian economy has changed from a centrally planned to a market oriented one, FDI is seen as an important component of the transition process toward a market-led economic system, since it contributes to the development of a country through multiple channels (Kukeli, et al., 2006; Kukeli, 2007). In their study, a limited number of successful mobile networks entry cases have been selected for deep investigation of entry models in Albania, to find out the most important and efficient determinants of foreign mobile networks entry into Albania's telecommunication market in the future as well. It provides a successful Albanian business experience for the newcomers in mobile telecommunications industry. With its developing market economy, Albania offers many opportunities for investors-property as labour costs are low, the young and educated population is ready to work, and tariffs and other legal restrictions are low in many cases and are being eliminated in some others (Albinvest, 2010). Location of Albania in itself offers a notable trade potential, especially with EU markets, since it shares borders with Greece and Italy. In the last years Albania has entered the free trade agreements with Balkan Countries creating the opportunity for trade throughout the region. As Albanian economy tends to grow, the prospects and opportunities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to invest in Albania for a long-term period has increased also. However, after the transition to democracy since 1992, the country has taken a long way in terms of economic, political and social life (Ministry of Economy 2004, p. 9-10). Demirel (2008) finds all of these changes to form the strengths of Albania in terms of FDI. In his study Demirel (2008) emphasizes that Albania has one of the most friendly investment environments in the region of the South- Eastern European Countries (SEECs) with her impressive economic performance in the last decade, liberal economic legislation, rapid privatisation process and country specific advantages. By taking into account all of these factors, the aim of this study is to offer a new perspective by the case studies of foreign telecommunications companies, which form the majority of MNEs in this field, by finding the most significant determinants before entering into Albania, with a successful entry strategy and crucial consideration of FDI in Albania. It is crucially important to find the determinants and factors that affect multinational firms when deciding on their entry modes, in order to successfully compete in the Albanian mobile telecoms industry. There are four operators in these industries; two of the leading firms expand rapidly in Albania by utilizing successful and aggressive entry strategies, and the other ones are new entries in Albanian market. Lin (2008) emphasizes that the evaluation of the entry modes’ determinants is better to be applied in some main theories and models such as transaction cost theory, eclectic theory and internationalization model, which serve as theoretical foundation in these kind of studies, where host-country condition, political and economic context, and organization capabilities are important factors and require major consideration.\n\nParagraph 21: Royal Rangers is an adventure-based, merit-driven, faith-based, church ministry and mentoring program for boys in grades K-12, providing “Christlike character formation and servant leadership development for boys and young men in a highly relational and fun environment\". The Royal Rangers program is active throughout the United States as well as in over 90 other nations; consequently, in 2002, 'Royal Rangers International' (RRI) was started. Royal Rangers in the USA is a boys-only program, unless the church does not have a girls ministry program; programs in some other nations allow both boys and girls to participate. The uniforms, mottos, practices and operation are derived from the Boy Scouts.\n\nParagraph 22: Adebisi began as a minor character; a member of the Homeboys and lieutenant of leader Jefferson Keane. He is first shown threatening to rape new cellmate Tobias Beecher on the latter's first night in prison. Like Keane and most of the other Homeboys, he immediately clashes with new muslim inmate Kareem Said, whose strict religious values oppose the Homeboys' reputation for drug abuse and violence. After Kareem begins to change Jefferson's mind and eventually converts him to Islam, Adebisi remains opposed, calling Said's teachings \"bullshit\" and continuing to side with the rest of the Homeboys. Following Keane's execution in Episode 4, Paul Markstrom takes over as the new leader of the Homeboys until Adebisi and Kenny Wangler kill him when it is discovered he is an undercover cop. Adebisi then takes over as the new leader and immediately partners in the drug trade with the Wiseguys, the prison's Italian gang. Their boss Nino Schibetta is shown to respect his leadership skills, seeing him as the best drug player among the black inmates. Adebisi, who works in the kitchen and sees himself as the boss, later grows annoyed with Schibetta after he instates Ryan O'Reily as the new boss of the kitchen. O'Reily however immediately begins to plot Schibetta's death, pitching to Adebisi the idea to insert crushed glass into Schibetta's food, which will slowly but painfully kill him. Adebisi agrees and the two form somewhat of an alliance, successfully carrying out their plan over the following weeks as Schibetta is eventually killed in episode 7. In the Season 1 finale, Adebisi, along with O'Reily, Said, Miguel Alvarez and Scott Ross, is one of the leaders of the Emerald City riot, representing the Homeboys. Throughout the episode, Adebisi and the rest of his gang are constantly seen abusing heroin, until they run out and are unable to source any more in the wake of the riot. Adebisi suffers a breakdown from the withdrawal, begging Said for more heroin, or \"tits\", as it is referred to in Oz; he and the rest of the Homeboys are subsequently tied up and taken prisoner by the other inmates towards the end of the standoff between the inmates and guards. In that episode, it is revealed that Adebisi's crime  was exploited to have swept the previous governor out of office and gave Governor James Devlin his opening to reinstate the death penalty, which later resulted in Keane's execution.\n\nParagraph 23: Revolution broke out in Spain in July 1936, marking what quickly came to be seen as the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Thanks to his engineering skills and training Bibbi was initially involved in the urgent tasks around reconfiguring and reorganising a range of production facilities in the industrial areas surrounding Valencia. The timelines in the sources become somewhat blurred in respect of his activities during the Civil War years between 1936 and 1939. There are references to his having used his piloting skills, for instance in terms of \"flying reconnaissance flights\", but having moved on quite soon after finding that the republican air force had come under the control of \"Stalinist\" elements. His activities during the Civil War evidently also involved him in frequent travel between Valencia and Barcelona and further afield, notably to Paris. It was in Paris that on 13 October 1936 Bibbi was suddenly arrested and sentenced to an eight-day prison sentence in respect of a new \"infringement of a decree of expulsion\". Back in Spain, it appears that he was keen to enlist as an aviator, to judge by a surviving message dated 3 November 1936, and sent from the Italian consulate in Tunis to the Interior Ministry in Rome, though the message in question is not entirely clear on the point. In December 1936 he was arrested by the local (republican) police and narrowly avoided being lynched by a crowd that quickly gathered round and accused him of being a \"Mussolini spy\". His life was saved only through the intervention of the Valencia regional CNT (trades union confederation) and the local council from Gandia, the nearby village in which he was still living with his family. During this part of the civil war he seems to have engaged in \"unseen warfare\", engaged in sabotage actions behind the frontlines, and in \"arms procurement and smuggling\" on behalf of republican fighters. Bibbi was nevertheless hampered in his effectiveness not just by the surveillance squads monitoring the role of Italian exiled anarchists in the fighting, but also by the constant attentions of Togliatti's \"secret police\". Togliatti's first loyalty was not to any Italian party but to Stalin, whom many across Europe on the non-anarchist political left continued to view as the best hope for a non-fascist future. It was Togliatti who is believed to have ordered and choreographed the deaths of Berneri and Francesco Barnieri during May 1937.\n\nParagraph 24: After the re-fit, she operated from Scapa Flow escorting Arctic convoys through the long Arctic nights of late 1943.  From 1944, she patrolled the English Channel in preparation for the Normandy Landings.  In this capacity, she closely co-operated with the Canadian Tribal-class destroyers  and .  For the invasion, she patrolled the channel and guarded against German surface ships in the Southwest Approaches and the Bay of Biscay area.  On 9 June, a German destroyer group was found off Brittany and engaged by Ashanti, Huron, Haida, as well as , , and the Polish destroyers  and  in the Battle of Ushant. The Kriegsmarine ship  was driven ashore and wrecked,  was severely damaged and , the ex-Dutch destroyer Gerard Callenburgh, was sunk. Her last action in the war was prevention of the evacuation of German personnel from France.  On 5 August 1944, she engaged a German convoy off the Île d'Yeu and sank two escort minesweepers and a Patrol Vessel.  Haida was damaged in the engagement. Ashanti was then taken in for an extensive and expensive re-fit and played no further part in the fighting.  Other Royal Navy Tribal-class destroyers were sent to Asia to fight against the Empire of Japan.\n\nParagraph 25: With Willoughby's ambush plan ruined, the scattered boats sought to rejoin Nereide, passing directly through the French squadron. Although several boats were in danger of being run down by the French ships and one even bumped alongside Minerve, all eventually rejoined Nereide safely. The opportunity to cause significant damage to the French in the narrow channel had been lost, with Bellone joining the squadron in passing through the channel with minimal resistance. In addition to British losses in the explosion at the fort, two men had been killed and one wounded on Nereide. French losses were more severe, Minerve suffered 23 casualties and Ceylon eight. With both sides recognising that further action was inevitable, Willoughby sent a boat to Sirius requesting additional assistance and Duperré sent a message overland with Lieutenant Morice, requesting support from Hamelin's squadron (Morice fell from his horse during the mission and was severely injured). Command of Victor passed to Henri Moisson. In the afternoon, Willoughby used mortars on Île de la Passe to shell the French squadron, forcing Duperré to retreat into the shallow harbour at Grand Port and Willoughby subsequently sent officers into Grand Port on 21 August under a flag of truce, demanding the release of Victor, which he insisted had surrendered and should thus be handed over to the blockade squadron as a prize. Duperré refused to consider the request. One French ship had failed to enter the channel off Grand Port: the captured East Indiaman Windham. Early on 21 August, her French commander attempted to shelter in Rivière Noire. Sirius spotted the merchant ship under the batteries there and sent two boats into the anchorage, stormed the ship and brought her out without a single casualty, despite the boarding party having forgotten to take any weapons with them and being only armed with wooden foot-stretchers wielded as clubs.\n\nParagraph 26: While the US Army deactivated its heavy armor units with the reception of the new M60 series main battle tanks in 1963, the remaining M103s stayed within the US Marine Corps inventory until they began receiving the M60 series main battle tank. With the disappearance of the heavy tank from US forces came the full acceptance of the main battle tank in 1960 for the US Army, and 1973 for the US Marine Corps. Although the later M1 Abrams main battle tank utilizes the same caliber of main gun, 120 mm, the M103's cannon was a rifled gun firing a separate-loading round, in which the projectile was loaded into the breech, followed by a cartridge case consisting of a brass case, primer, and propellant in a fixed unit. This separate-loading system necessitated the use of two loaders. The only part of the cartridge case consumed during firing was the propellant and a plastic cap on the end of the brass cartridge case. The spent brass cartridge case was ejected after firing. The M1 tank's 120 mm main gun is a smooth bore firing a semi-caseless round, ejecting only a back cap of the original loaded round; the bulk of the M1's 120 mm shell casing is consumed during firing.\n\nParagraph 27: The Grant County Airport was dedicated on November 30, 1951, serving the communities of Silver City, Hurley, Lordsburg, and Deming, New Mexico, as well as smaller communities in the so-called \"Mining District,\" including Arenas Valley, Fort Bayard, Central (now Santa Clara), Bayard, and Santa Rita.The next day, on December 1, 1951 Frontier Airlines began operating flights from the airport as a stop on their route from El Paso to Phoenix, which also included stops at Clifton, Safford, and Tucson, Arizona. Before the opening of the Grant County Airport, the airline was serving local airports in Deming, NM and Lordsburg, NM; however, service to those cities was then discontinued. By 1956 the route to Phoenix was modified to originate in Albuquerque rather than El Paso and service to Clifton and Safford was later discontinued which made for nonstop flights from Silver City to Tucson and Phoenix. At that time and on into the mid-1960s, the airline was flying the Douglas DC-3. Later, Frontier served the airport with larger Convair 340 prop aircraft followed by Convair 580 turboprops. Frontier's flights to Tucson and Phoenix were discontinued in 1974 and a small commuter carrier, Zia Airlines, began flights to Albuquerque with Cessna 402 and Handley Page Jetstream propjets in 1976. In the midst of growing into an all jet airline, Frontier ended their service in late 1979. Zia Airlines went out of business in early 1980 and Air Midwest began operating later that year under an Essential Air Service (EAS) contract with flights to Albuquerque using Swearingen Metroliner aircraft. Another commuter, Airways of New Mexico, operated flights to El Paso for a short time in 1980 as well. In 1985 the EAS contract was shifted from Air Midwest to Mesa Airlines which came to Silver City with service to Albuquerque using Beechcraft 99 and Beechcraft 1900D. Mesa's flights continued for 20 years until 2005 when the EAS contract was awarded to Great Lakes Airlines. Great Lakes started service with flights to Albuquerque, also using Beech 1900D's, but switched the flights to Phoenix in late 2012. Great Lakes ended all service in late 2014 and the EAS contract was then awarded to Boutique Air which began service in early 2015. Boutique provided flights to both Albuquerque and Phoenix using Pilatus PC-12 aircraft for four years until the EAS contract was then transferred to Advanced Air. Advanced Air began service in early 2019 with similar service to Albuquerque and Phoenix but uses a larger, multi engine, Beechcraft Super King Air model 350. Two other commuter airlines that served the Silver City to El Paso market for short periods were Aztec Airlines in 1966 and Turner Air in 1985.\n\nParagraph 28: With the rapid weakening erosion of the authority of the Qing dynasty in 1840s–1850s, Korea resisted traditional subservience to China.  Japan was rapidly modernizing in the second half of the 19th century but worried that China or Russia would use Korea to threaten Japan. With the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, Japan decided the expansion of their settlement, the addition of the market and acquired an enclave in Busan. A severe conflict at court between Heungseon Daewongun, the biological father of Gojong (king of the Joseon Dynasty), and Gojong's wife Empress Myeongseong continued. In 1882, Daewongun was seized by the Qing military, and confined in Tianjin City (Jingo Incident). The Min clan including Queen Min assumed authority, but relations between Korea and Japan did not turn better, the Min clan changing their policies from being pro-Japanese to pro-Qing China. When Japan beat China in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was concluded, and removed China's suzerainty over Korea. Japan became alarmed when Russia enhanced its grip and influence over the Korean peninsula by acquiring vital state assets such as the mining rights in Chongsong and Gyeongwon sold off by Queen Min, such as timber rights in the north, and tariff rights, so it purchased back and restored many of these. Japan's victory against China in the First Sino-Japanese War, released Korea from China's tributary system and the Treaty of Shimonoseki forced China to acknowledge Korea as an \"independent\" nation. Japan began the process of invading Korea; however, the Min clan, including the Queen Min, started attempts to protect Korea from the rise of Japanese power in Korea. In 1895, Queen Min was gang raped, assassinated and then burned in public by Japan's military, in retaliation for her efforts to promote Russian influence and resist the Japanese invasion. The brutal assassination of the queen was a traumatic event, given Queen Min's popularity among the Korean people. The Gabo Reform and the assassination of Empress Myeongseong generated backlash against Japanese presence in Korea; it caused some Confucian scholars, as well as farmers, to form over 60 successive righteous armies to fight for Korean freedom on the Korean peninsula.\n\nParagraph 29: Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote, \"The character that Goldie Hawn creates in this movie is so refreshing and so interesting that they should have gone ahead and made the extra effort and written an intelligent screenplay about her.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded 2 stars out of 4 and wrote that it played like a \"bad sequel\" to Hawn's earlier hit, Private Benjamin. Siskel suggested that \"it might have been intended as some kind of emotional Frank Capra film with Hawn in the Jimmy Stewart role. But Stewart never would have stood for all the grade-Z slapstick material here, including a truly pathetic, protracted barroom brawl scene in which an Arab stereotype (André Gregory in a humiliating role) is turned on by sado-masochism.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"Though everything in 'Protocol' has been most carefully contrived, it has been contrived by talented people, particularly by Mr. Henry.\" Variety stated, \"Moving far away from the disaster of 'Swing Shift' and back toward the smash success of 'Private Benjamin,' Hawn is once again properly bubbly (and brainy), but one big problem here is an oh-so-obvious effort to reinvent the formula that boosted 'Benjamin' to new heights.\" Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post called it \"the kind of corny screwball comedy you thought nobody made anymore. By the end, its ersatz political moralism is almost too much to take; but buoyed by Buck Henry's often hilarious script, a wiggy performance by Goldie Hawn as a not-so-dumb blond, and director Herbert Ross' sure comic touch, 'Protocol' is pleasant piffle for a Sunday afternoon.\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Goldie Hawn is likable—even if this movie (which might actually be subtitled 'Private Benjamin' Goes to Washington') is not.\" Kim Newman of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the movie's most obvious influence was the 1950 film Born Yesterday, \"but without displaying any understanding of why it worked so well. Its most explicit borrowing is from what now seems Born Yesterday's most embarrassing scene—the dumb blond being converted to committed patriotism by reading the original Constitution and touring Washington's state monuments.\"\n\nParagraph 30: When HUD finished terminating its interests in the project in 1977 the completed structures from the new city were one of the educational and community facilities, one of the community pools, one of the community parks, underground infrastructure (Electric, Water, Sewer, Gas and Cable TV) and a water treatment facility.  The original educational and community facility housed the entire K-12 school system until the 1980s when Richard Mann Elementary was built on the site of the former community garden at 1366 Waterford Road.  After renovations the HUD-financed facility contained grades 6-12 until the early 2000s, when the completion of Ruben A. Cirillo high school meant that the original building would only house grades 6-8 and the District offices.  The single completed community pool was at 3290 Wildflower Drive and was operated by the community until the early 1990s when financial difficulties caused the property to be sold to the YMCA of Greater Rochester.  It operated as a YMCA facility until the early 2000s when it shut down for the last time.  The pool and original pool building still exist though now as part of a private residence.  The community did not lose access to a public pool though as the opening of Ruben A. Cirillo high school also brought about major renovations and additions to Richard Mann Elementary, one of which was an indoor pool open to the public.  The only completed public park was Fox Tail Park, located in the center of the area Wildflower drive encircles.  It originally contained a full playground and sports fields of which only the sports fields remain (presently used by the Middle School).  The playground was removed in the early 1990s for a new parking lot and gym addition on the present-day Middle school. In 2018 a new playground was built at the Gananda Elementary School. The older grass sports field was also replaced with AstroTurf, new track, bleachers, and security fencing. In addition to these buildings, Gananda is still unique from its neighboring towns in the sense that all utility lines are buried underground whereas once one leaves Gananda utilities are once again carried above ground by utility poles.  When HUD discontinued its financial backing of the project the roadbed for both sides of a four-lane Gananda Parkway had already been constructed from Eddy Road to almost Walworth/Penfield Road, State Route 441 (itself slated to have been widened to a four-lane highway had the City of Gananda ever come to fruition).  However, with funding from the original project gone, only one side was completed which forms the current Gananda Parkway.  The roadbed for the other side of the original four-lane Gananda Parkway is still visible in person as well as via satellite imagery and an easement still exists if population growth ever warrants its completion.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe Grant County Airport in New Mexico was opened in 1951 and served several communities in the area. Frontier Airlines began operating flights from the airport the following day, connecting it to El Paso and Phoenix, with stops at various cities along the way. Over the years, the airline changed its routes and aircraft, eventually discontinuing its flights to Tucson and Phoenix in 1974. After Frontier, several other commuter airlines operated at the airport, including Zia Airlines, Airways of New Mexico, Mesa Airlines, Great Lakes Airlines, Boutique Air, and Advanced Air. Each airline offered flights to Albuquerque and/or Phoenix, using different aircraft models. Aztec Airlines and Turner Air also briefly served the Silver City to El Paso market.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: In 2003, Johnston joined the program Players Inc Radio when it moved to Fox Sports Radio. The program was sponsored by NFL Players Inc. Since 2013, Johnston has worked as a color commentator alongside Kenny Albert and formerly Dick Stockton.  Previously, Johnston was on the second broadcast team with Stockton from 2001–06 and Albert from 2007-13. He also worked with Tony \"Goose\" Siragusa, until Siragusa's firing from the network following the 2015 season. In 2000, Johnston got his start calling NFL games by working the regular season and doing the High Definition broadcast of Super Bowl XXXV with Kevin Harlan for CBS Sports. He was an analyst for the NFL Network's \"Total Access\" until 2012. Johnston also began calling the collegiate Cotton Bowl Classic game for Fox in 2009, first with Pat Summerall, and then eventually Kenny Albert. He also was a guest star of the PBS television series Wishbone in its episode \"Moonbone\". He appears as a regular guest on First Things First on FS1 (2017/2018) with Cris Carter, Nick Wright and Jenna Wolfe. In 2017, he continued his esteemed broadcasting career with NFL on FOX, teamed with Chris Myers and Laura Okmin. In 2020, he became paired with Kevin Burkhardt and Pam Oliver. He is currently paired with Joe Davis and Pam Oliver as the number 2 crew with FOX.\n\nParagraph 2: All missions are based upon actual missions ranging from strafing attacks of World War II, the open dogfights of late 20th century air warfare, and the combat missions of Vietnam, which included bomber escorts. The name of the actual pilot involved and the outcome of the encounter are told to the player, as a way for the player to judge air combat prowess (though it did not affect the overall scoring). This feature separated the game from other similar games of its time, and influenced future work on later flight simulations. However, large, famous battles in the wars are not included (for example, there are no D-Day, Pearl Harbor, or Battle of Britain missions). For World War II, the missions are based solely on the European Theater of Operations.\n\nParagraph 3:  Kerry and Kay Danes are an Australian husband and wife who were controversially arrested and subjected to physical violence on 23 December 2000 by authorities in Laos. The Danes were detained without charge in a detention centre in Vientiane, Laos, for six months until formal charges were laid on 13 June 2001. According to the Australian Foreign Ministry, the Danes were wrongly accused by the Pathet Lao officials in Laos of embezzlement, destruction of evidence and violation of Laotian tax regulations. On 28 June 2001, the Danes were taken to the Laotian Municipal Court in Vientiane where they faced trial by a judge and prosecutor appointed by communist officials. The already typed judgment was delivered within 25 minutes. Found guilty, they were sentenced to 7 years imprisonment and ordered to pay compensation, which led to the intervention of the Australian Government. On 6 November 2001 the Danes were pardoned by the President of Laos. After their ordeal, Kay Danes became a human rights advocate and in 2012 was named as an Australian of the Year state finalist. Following the release of Kerry and Kay Danes in Laos, Kay Danes was invited to speak at the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos in Washington, D.C., in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Library of Congress, where she testified in 2002 and on numerous occasions on Capitol Hill regarding human rights violations in Laos and the plight of political prisoners and foreign prisoners held by the communist government of Laos. Kay Danes was appointed an Honorary Advisor to the Executive Office of the Prime Minister representing the Royal Lao Government in Exile. She is recognised throughout the Laotian community as the most effective mover they have had, as an ally, in their long-standing struggle for freedom from persecution. She was a driving force behind the establishment of the United Lao Action Centre in Washington DC - to give a voice to those seeking to uphold the rights of victims of human rights abuses and victims of injustice. Kay Danes lobbied at several US Congressional Forums for greater consideration to new foreign investors embarking on new business ventures in Laos, to avoid some of the pitfalls of working in such a challenging environment. One of the many highlights of her advocacy was to engage the US Government, in particular, President George Bush's direct representative, in a debate on the Normalised Trade Relations Agreement  between the US and Laos, insisting on greater protections for foreigners investing in Laos, prior to its implementation. The NTR agreement was effectively delayed until such assurances could be given.\n\nParagraph 4: Safdarabad, formerly known as Mandi Dhaban Singh, is a City of Sheikhupura District in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Mandi Dhaban Singh has been a famous grain market and it was named after Dhaab Singh a Sikh settler in the area after 1876 settlement plan of British Colonialists . Firstly, mandi Dhabban singh was just a railway station and it was after Chaudhry Chunni Laal (a Hindu investor and entrepreneur) the city had taken a new look, Chunni Laal was an excellent entrepreneur and had owned almost 80% capital of the city. He had a cotton factory called \"Chaudhery Cotton Mill\", a last chimney of this factory was replaced by The Boutter Market.The City is the headquarter of Safdarabad Tehsil - an administrative subdivision of the district. Safdarabad was named after Mr Safdar-Ul-Haq Dogar Known as \"Chabba Dogar\". He was a Member Of Provincial Assembly who was murdered in 1989 in front of Punjab Assembly Lahore. He was nephew of X-MPA Sardar Abdul Rasheed Dogar (1990 election) and Brother of X-MPA Sardar Saeed-ul Haq Dogar (1997 election).The then Chief Minister, Mian Nawaz Sharif named the city safdarabad after him on his visit after Safdar's Death, but when Rai Ijaz won the election of provincial assembly in 1993 and become provincial minister for forests then Safderabad was once named as \"Ahmed pur\" after Haji Ahmed hassan father of both Rai saeed and Rai Ijaz. In 1997 general election again dogar group won the election of provincial assembly and asked Mian Shahbaz shareef to issue a notification once again regarding name of the city, Shahbaz shareef restored the name \"Safdarabad\", Fight on naming the city after their own loved ones remained furious for a decade and the then DPO sheikhupura and some other officials had requested both dogar and rajput groups to bury the hatchet. Both groups were called in a mosque and were sworn to remain agree on one name \"Safderabad\".\n\nParagraph 5: During his attempts to establish the truth, Sathyam faces various troubles. The Minister's proxies give him various troubles by killing children by offering them ice creams laced with drugs to eat and killing his mother. When Sathyam arrests Acharya, the Minister's proxy, and takes him to court, the Minister's henchmen attack him while driving and Sathyam is stabbed. Thillanayagam (Dilli Babu in Telugu version), the other proxy, shoots Acharya and blames Sathyam. Sathyam performs his mother's funeral rites and is suspended from the force and jailed. Manicka Vel, to be released the next day, feels sad for Sathyam and laments his loss in the jail. Thillanayagam runs for MLA with the Minister's support so that he cannot be harmed by Sathyam. He gloats to Sathyam at the jail about his newfound power and challenges Sathyam's honor and dignity. At a public rally for Thillanayagam's candidature, the Kondal Dasan openly challenges and insults Sathyam, who is released from jail by a sympathetic officer and coming to disrupt the public rally. Manicka Vel stands in the corner aiming to kill Thillanayagam and the Dasan. Sathyam arrives and exposes the Minister and Thillanayagam by shooting them and forcing them to confess the truth about the Minister's intentions and the death of the proxy. Thillanayagam reveals everything about himself, Acharya, and Dasan. While lamenting the situation he is in and calling for reform, Sathyam is shot by the Minister's henchman and questions the honesty and trust his people and fellow officers have in him. Manicka Vel arrives on the scene and salutes Sathyam, with other officers following suit. A newscast is shown with Kondal Dasan and Thillanayagam being arrested and Sathyam is reinstated in the police force. Sathyam is promoted to Deputy Commissioner by the Chief Minister and marries Deivanayaki, and the credits roll.\n\nParagraph 6: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Squad Leader in Company B, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 12 September 1951. With his company pinned down and suffering heavy casualties under murderous machine-gun, rifle, artillery and mortar fire laid down from heavily fortified, deeply entrenched hostile strongholds on Hill 673, Sergeant Mausert unhesitatingly left his covered position and ran through a heavily mined and fire-swept area to bring back two critically wounded men to the comparative safety of the lines. Staunchly refusing evacuation despite a painful head wound sustained during his voluntary act, he insisted on remaining with his squad and, with his platoon ordered into the assault moments later, took the point position and led his men in a furious bayonet charge against the first of a literally impregnable series of bunkers. Stunned and knocked to the ground when another bullet struck his helmet, he regained his feet and resumed his drive, personally silencing the machine-gun and leading his men in eliminating several other emplacements in the area. Promptly reorganizing his unit for a renewed fight to the final objective on top of the ridge, Sergeant Mausert boldly left his position when the enemy's fire gained momentum and, making a target of himself, boldly advanced alone into the face of the machine gun, drawing the fire away from his men and enabling them to move into position to assault. Again severely wounded when the enemy's fire found its mark, he still refused aid and continued spearheading the assault to the topmost machine-gun nest and bunkers, the last bulwark of the fanatic aggressors. Leaping into the wall of fire, he destroyed another machine-gun with grenades before he was mortally wounded by bursting grenades and machine-gun fire. Stouthearted and indomitable, Sergeant Mausert, by his fortitude, great personal valor and extraordinary heroism in the face of almost certain death, had inspired his men to sweep on, overrun and finally secure the objective. His unyielding courage throughout reflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States Marine Corps. He gallantly gave his life for his country.\n\nParagraph 7: The progression begins with Reg Birkett's try, scored in the first international rugby match of any code in 1871 when England succumbed to Scotland at Raeburn Place. When Birkett's try was scored, it was not worth any points in itself, but rather afforded the opportunity of the scoring side to kick a goal, or a \"try at goal\", which England failed to convert. Birkett, who also played association football for England, was for a short time during the match the joint international record holder as well, matching Angus Buchanan's earlier effort for Scotland. Despite the record being but a single try, Birkett's mark of one try for England stood for almost six years, although this equated at the time to just ten matches. In that time, at least a further eleven players matched the feat of scoring a try for England before William Hutchinson scored his second try of the match and his career in the eleventh England match on 5 February 1877. Hutchinson set a mark that was to last for exactly four years when Henry Taylor, who had already equalled the record, scored three times against Ireland on 5 February 1881. Taylor played in the same side as another prolific scorer of tries, George Burton. Burton equalled the mark of five tries in England's comprehensive victory over Wales in the latter's first international. In that match, on 19 February 1881, of the thirteen tries scored, Taylor scored once but Burton scored four times, which was in itself a record haul for one match that was to last until 1907. The tries scored in this match brought both players to six apiece, but as to which of these players reached that mark first is unclear. It was not until 1885 that another pairing of prolific try scorers, Wilfred Bolton and Charles Wade, both equalled the haul of six tries. Wade went on to hold the record outright for over fifteen years after he scored his seventh try on 2 January 1886 against Wales. It was Tot Robinson that was to break this record on 9 March 1901 with his mark of eight tries and no one challenged this until Arthur Hudson equalled and then broke it at Parc des Princes when England defeated France on 3 March 1910. For the third time, England was fielding a pairing of prolific try scorers, and alongside Hudson was John Birkett. John Birkett was the son of England's first try scorer, Reg Birkett and had scored the first try at Twickenham Stadium. He went on to set the England record with ten tries on 8 April 1912.\n\nParagraph 8: The main feud on the Raw brand was between Goldberg and Triple H, with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam, Triple H and Goldberg were involved in the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship. After Goldberg eliminated three other men in that match, he went after Triple H. At the end, Goldberg attempted another Spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg in the head with a sledgehammer for the win. On the August 25 episode of Raw, Goldberg issued a one-on-one challenge to Triple H. Triple H came out and stated that he would defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg at Unforgiven. Triple H added the stipulation that should Goldberg lose, he would retire from professional wrestling. At Unforgiven, Goldberg defeated Triple H when he performed a Jackhammer to win the title. On the September 29 episode of Raw, Triple H made an announcement, offering a bounty of $100,000 to anyone who could successfully \"take out\" Goldberg. The first person that attempted to take the bounty was Steven Richards, but Goldberg quickly took him out. Many other people tried and failed to take him out including La Résistance, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer. It was during a World Heavyweight Championship match between Goldberg and Shawn Michaels on the October 20 episode of Raw, however, that he was taken out. Batista ran-in, dragged Michaels out of the ring and, in storyline, assaulted him. Batista then entered the ring, and proceeded to attack Goldberg. He put a folding chair around Goldberg's ankle, before jumping off the middle rope onto the chair, in storyline, \"shattering\" Goldberg's ankle. Evolution then made their way to the ring, and gave the $100,000 bounty to Batista. With Goldberg seemingly out of action, Raw Co-General Manager Eric Bischoff looked set to present Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship on the October 27 episode of Raw. The other Co-General Manager of Raw, Stone Cold Steve Austin came to the ring, however, and announced that Goldberg would be back to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. Goldberg got his revenge on Batista on the November 3 episode of Raw as he performed a spear to Batista. He attempted to injure Batista using the same technique that Batista used on Goldberg. Ric Flair tried to intervene, but he too got speared. Austin then announced that Batista and Goldberg would go one-on-one. On the November 10 episode of Raw, Goldberg looked set to beat Batista, but Triple H interfered, signaling a Disqualification. Triple H got his signature Sledgehammer out from underneath the ring, and looked set to attack Goldberg with it, but Goldberg managed to fight back, and speared Triple H. Goldberg picked up the sledgehammer, and attacked Batista with it.\n\nParagraph 9: Lady Macbeth is a powerful presence in the play, most notably in the first two acts. Following the murder of King Duncan, however, her role in the plot diminishes. She becomes an uninvolved spectator to Macbeth's plotting and a nervous hostess at a banquet dominated by her husband's hallucinations. Her sleepwalking scene in the fifth act is a turning point in the play, and her line \"Out, damned spot!\" has become a phrase familiar to many speakers of the English language. The report of her death late in the fifth act provides the inspiration for Macbeth's \"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\" speech.\n\nParagraph 10: Awards and decorations1921: Awarded an exceptional move, the 3rd Battalion of the Fiscal Guard degree of Officer of the Order of the Tower and of the Sword, of Valour, Loyalty and Merit (by the action of this Battalion in Republican Revolt 31 January 1891, in the city.

The combination of youth and experience overcame their opponents as Tigre Blanco and Molotov won two falls to one. The second match saw the continuation of a storyline feud between Rey Cometa and Puma King as they were on opposite sides of a Best two out of three falls six-man tag team match. Cometa teamed up with Starman and Stuka, Jr. while Puma King teamed with the veteran rudos (wrestlers who portray the \"bad guy\" characters, also called \"heel\")  Sangre Azteca and Virus. In the third and deciding fall Puma King caused his team to be disqualified when he landed an illegal low blow on Rey Cometa, furthering the tension between the two that had already been building over the previous month or so. The third match saw Lady Apache continue her rudo ways, firmly establishing her as a rudo as she teamed up with La Seductora and Princesa Blanca to take on the team of Dark Angel, Estrellita and Goya Kong. In the first fall Goya Kong pulled La Seductora's mask off, drawing a disqualification for her team. While her actions in previous weeks could be explained as being emotional or making a mistake, her actions in the second fall clearly demonstrated Lady Apache's switch to the opposite side as she threw a handful of white powder in Dark Angel's face while the referee was distracted. Apache quickly pinned the temporarily blinded Dark Angel. Following the match all competitors talked about the upcoming Infierno en el Ring steel cage match that would take place the following week. Over the previous weeks the group known as Los Guerreros del Infierno had been showing signs of dissension, especially between group leader Último Guerrero and Rey Escorpión. Tonight the two teamed up with Dragón Rojo, Jr. to take on the team of Diamante Azul, La Mascara and La Sombra. Rey Escorpión forced La Sombra to submit in the first fall, with Los Guerreros taking the second fall for their side. During the third and final fall Guerrero locked in a submission hold on La Mascara, seemingly with victory in hand. Then Rey Escorpión entered the ring and applied a second submission hold on La Mascara, which caused the referee to disqualify the team for excessive violence, costing them the match just as it looked like Los Guerrero del Infierno were about to win. Following the loss Último Guerrero expressed his dissatisfaction with his team mate.\n\nParagraph 12: United Nations Administrative tribunal  with Judge Sumar Sen as president,  in a seminal  Judgment on affirmative action,  held   : \"that the various resolutions for Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat which have been referred to and statements of the Secretary-General have conceded the existence of an unsatisfactory history with respect to the recruitment and promotion of women that does not accord with Article 8 of the Charter. In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Article 8 of the Charter must be regarded as a source of authority for reasonable efforts to improve the status of women. It would be anomalous indeed if this  unsatisfactory history had to remain unremedied for an unduly long period. Unless affirmative action measures are taken towards ameliorating the effects of this past history, they will, without doubt, be perpetuated for many years. This is incompatible with the objectives of Article 8, as recognized by the General Assembly. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that Article 8 permits the adoption of reasonable affirmative action measures for improvement of the status of women.\" The Tribunal added that,  \"as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates; obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior\". The Tribunal, however, cautioned that affirmative action, however laudable, did not justify any weakening of the requirements of Article 101 (3) of the Charter that officials of the Organization be of \"the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity\": \"In evaluating the reasonableness of affirmative action measures, pertinent provisions of the Charter may not be ignored.  The Tribunal considers that, with respect to affirmative action measures, it would be impermissible to view Article 8 of the Charter as overriding Article 101 (3) ... This language unequivocally establishes a standard under which less qualified persons are not entitled to preferential treatment based on gender. The fundamental principle reflected in Article 101 (3) may not be diluted by a desire, however commendable, to overcome past problems.” The Tribunal concluded that, \"as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates(emphasis added); obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior\".\n\nParagraph 13: In his youth, Bettencourt was a member of La Cagoule (The Hood), a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group. Eugène Schueller, founder of L'Oréal, provided financial support and held meetings for La Cagoule at the company's headquarters. In the 1990s, Jean Frydman, a shareholder and board member of L'Oréal's film and television subsidiary Paravision, alleged that he had been sacked in 1989 as the senior management at L'Oréal sought to avoid an Arab boycott of firms with Jewish links. Frydman held joint French and Israeli citizenship. Frydman also turned up the fact that Bettencourt had written several articles for a Nazi propaganda organ during World War II. From 1940 to 1942, Bettencourt wrote more than 60 articles for La Terre Française, a newspaper that flourished with Nazi German financing during the occupation of France. In a special Easter issue in 1941, he described Jews as 'hypocritical Pharisees' whose 'race has been forever sullied by the blood of the righteous. They will be cursed'. Bettencourt attempted to dismiss the journalism as \"errors of youth\", claiming that his judgement was clouded by the propaganda of Vichy France. \"I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them\".\n\nParagraph 14: Both men and women dance together, dressed in traditional costume. At the commencement of the dance, participants form two circles, the women, who form a small inner circle, are encompassed by men, who form a large circle around them, and They move first in clockwise then in anti-clockwise direction determining the rhythm of the dance by the beating together of sticks and striking of drums. As the dance proceeds, the participants change places, with men forming the inner circle. Sometimes, it is performed exclusively by men folk. At that time, a series of half-swirls make up a simpler version of the dance depending on the dancer`s ability & proficiency, it is danced with a series of intricate pattern steps. The striking of sticks gives the dance a vigorous character & consistent tempo. Gair dances by Bhil folk are performed with wearing colourful dresses and carrying swords, arrows and sticks. It is the major attraction of people. There are many differences in the performance of men and women in this dance. The sticks used in the dance are called Khanda. It is danced with a series of intricate pattern steps. The striking of the sticks gives the dance a vigorous character and a consistent tempo. When they are dancing it seems as if they are depicting a scene from war front. It is believed by the locals that this dance must have got some significance to war. This form of dance is also seen in Africa and Central Asia. These sticks are very attractive and catch every eye. The sticks play vital role in the dance. They are very thin and does not carry much of weight and give a flare look. These sticks are cut from the Gundi tree and involves little cleaning process. In some places instead of sticks swords are used .In one hand the dancers carries the naked sword and in the other hand is occupied with Khanda(a name of sword in Rajasthan) or the stick.  Apart from this Gair is also of third type in which the dancers carry sword in one hand and in the other hand they carry the wooden sword.\n\nParagraph 15: The Church itself is used by Christ as a means of grace: \"As sacrament, the Church is Christ's instrument. 'She is taken up by him also as the instrument for the salvation of all', 'the universal sacrament of salvation'.\" The conviction that the Church herself is the primary means of grace can be traced back to Irenaeus, who was expressing a common conviction when he said: \"Where the church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God is, there is the church, and every kind of grace.\" However, as the Second Vatican Council lamented, \"although the Catholic Church has been endowed with all divinely revealed truth and with all means of grace, yet its members fail to live by them with all the fervor that they should\".\n\nParagraph 16: Carroll was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on April 8, 1958, the son of Maurice C. and Margaret W. Carroll.  Although his parents resided in New Jersey, his father's military service carried him to Fort Bragg at the time of his son's birth.  Both of Carroll's parents are former reporters, his father having written for the New York Herald Tribune, The New York Times and Newsday, while his mother wrote for the Daily Record. His father has been the director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. He is of German and Irish descent. Carroll moved with his family to Morris Township, New Jersey in 1960. Carroll attended public school in the Morris School District through grammar school, then Delbarton School, from which he graduated in 1976.  He attended Johns Hopkins University, earning a B.A. in Social and Behavioral Sciences in 1980.  He pursued his legal education at Rutgers School of Law–Newark, receiving his J.D. in 1983. While at Johns Hopkins, Carroll served as the Region II Co-Director for the College Republican National Federation and held various offices in the Johns Hopkins Republican Club, including President.  In 1978, he interned in the offices of Congressman Jack Kemp.  During law school, he served briefly as an aide to State Senator John Dorsey. He also founded the Morris County Young Republicans, serving as the Chairman of that group for four years.  He was first elected to the Morris County Republican Committee for Morris Township in 1980.  In 1984, after moving to Morristown, he was elected to the Republican County Committee there, serving as chairman for one term.  Returning to Morris Township, he was once again elected to the Republican County Committee, a position he presently holds.  He is also a Member of the Knights of Columbus, the Federalist Society and the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick.\n\nParagraph 17: India disagrees with Pakistan's claims because in 1908, when the dispute arose between the Sindh Division and Rao Maharaj, the whole area was under the legal jurisdiction of the Bombay Presidency of British India, including the Sindh Division and the territory of Rao Maharaj. The Sindh Division was separated from the Bombay Presidency only on 1 April 1936 when it became the Sindh Province. The government of the Bombay Presidency conducted a survey in 1911 and awarded a dispute resolution verdict in 1914 containing two contradictory paragraphs. Paragraph 9 of the verdict states that the border between Kutch and Sindh lies to the east of Sir Creek, whereas paragraph 10 of the verdict further qualifies that \"since Sir Creek is navigable most of the year. According to international law and the thalweg principle, a boundary can only be fixed in the middle of the navigable channel, which meant that it has been divided between Sindh and Kutch, and thereby India and Pakistan.\" The text of the resolution suggests that the resolution was based on the thalweg principle. India supports its stance by citing the thalweg doctrine in international law. The thalweg legal principle states that if the border between two political entities is stated to be a waterway without further description (e.g. a median line, right bank, eastern shore, low tide line, etc.), the boundary follows the thalweg of that watercourse; in particular, the boundary follows the center of the principal navigable channel of the waterway (which is presumably the deepest part). If there are multiple navigable channels in a river, the one principally used for downstream travel (likely having the strongest current) is used. When the thalweg principle is applied, the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) supports India's position, which \"would result in the shifting of the land/sea terminus point several kilometres to the detriment of Pakistan, leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its Exclusive Economic Zone under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea.\"\n\nParagraph 18: Although Jardine’s Lookout is commonly known as where Cavendish Heights is located at, the multi-block estate sits on the fringe of Jardine’s Lookout, on the border of Mount Butler, which is on the eastern side of block one. Residential buildings such as Park Garden, Flora Garden and Elm Tree Towers on Tai Hang Drive and Chun Fai Road are considered as the upper part of Tai Hang, below Mount Butler not Jardine’s Lookout. The area has large detached houses in private lots and more moderate townhouses. Low-rise and high-rise apartments make up the rest of the community. Houses in private lots include ones built in the 1950s which were in recent years sold to wealthy mainlanders. In 2015, Cheung Chung-kiu, Chairman of CC Land, reportedly purchased 1 Purves Road for about HK$760 million, or around HK$100,000 per square foot. In 2019, Joseph Lau Luen-hung's residence at Goldsmith Road ranked the fifth as Hong Kong’s most expensive residential properties in rental value estimated by the Hong Kong Government, with an annual estimated rental value of HK$8.23 million. In 2018, this house was reportedly by Apple Daily to be worth HK$2.5 billion. Translating into HK$250,000 per sq. ft. based on internal floor area of around 10,000 square feet,) it is the most valuable house in Hong Kong, followed by 75 Deep Water Bay Road. In 2020, the site at 20 Perkins Road was sold for HK$850 million representing a 40 percent drop compared to previous market transactions. This price translated into over HK$82,000 per square foot compared to another site on Perkins Road in 2018 which changed hands at HK$145,000 per square foot.  \n\nParagraph 19: The film begins with the birthday celebrations of Baghdad prince Faruk when Chief Commander Vazeer Hussain (Rajanala) forcibly collects taxes from the public. Sultan (Mikkilineni) of Baghdad realises it and one night he travels in disguise to identify the truth. At that moment, Vazeer kills him, confines his Begam Saheba (Pandari Bai) in prison and also tries to eliminate the Prince, but he is saved by Ibrahim (Mukkamala), a blind loyal royal agent. After that, Vazeer becomes Sultan of Baghdad. Ibrahim shifts to Basra, Faruk grows as Abu (N. T. Rama Rao) and becomes a kind-hearted burglar who helps the poor along with his friend Ali (Padmanabham). One day he enters Basra Sultan's (Relangi) palace, where he gets the acquaintance of princess Naseem (Jayalalitha) and both of them fall in love. Meanwhile, Vazeer arrives at Basra, decides to marry Naseem by luring the Sultan to which Naseem refuses and escapes. At the same time, Abu enters into the palace to meet Naseem when Vazeer captures him. Even after escaping Naseem comes into Vazeer's fold and he takes her to Baghdad. On the other side, Abu breaks out the jail with the help of Ali, learns regarding Naseem and reaches Baghdad. After reaching Baghdad palace he recognises himself as the prince. Now Abu makes a plan along with Nazeem to find his mother. There onwards, Abu makes huge robberies in the kingdom and attains the name  The Thief of Baghdad. Meanwhile, Ali insults a street magician, so, he converts him into a monkey and says that he will get his original form if he dips into the water. Abu recognises that the monkey is his friend Ali and keeps him in the palace at Sadiq (Madhukuuri Satyam) Vazeer's son. Parallelly, Nazeem pretends love with Vazeer, finds the whereabouts of Begam Saheba and Abu releases his mother. But unfortunately, they were caught by soldiers, Vazeer orders to leave Abu in the desert, and throw Ali (Monkey) into the well and they do so. Then Ali comes into his original form. Meanwhile, Ibrahim generates public to revolt, all of them reach the fort along with Begam Saheba and reveal the entire truth. Eventually, in the desert, Abu liberates a demon, for which he gets a flying carpet as a gift; with its help, he immediately rushes the fort and stamps out Vazeer. Finally, Abu / Faruk becomes the emperor of Baghdad and marries Nazeem.\n\nParagraph 20: In August 2006, Milian sued the co-writer and producer of \"Dip It Low\", Poli Paul, claiming that Paul \"very definitively\" assured her that \"there were no samples whatsoever in [...] 'Dip It Low'\". The issue had arisen in February 2005, when Thomas Turino, Larry Crook, and Dan Dickey sued Milian over the song, claiming that it contained a sample from a track they released in 1983 called \"La Sirena\". The lawsuit claimed that Paul heard the album while in a record store, liked the tune and sampled twelve seconds of it for \"Dip It Low\". These twelve seconds are repeated in a loop throughout the entire song. This suit was successful and the plaintiffs recovered over a million dollars (after lawyer expenses) divided 40% for Turino (the composer of the theme of the song), and 30% each for Dickey and Crook.  Milian claimed that she had to spend more than $300,000 defending herself in the case, which she settled in 2006, and wanted $300,000 plus damages from Paul and his associate, Spencer Cowlings Entertainment. In November 2006, Paul countersued the Island Def Jam Music Group and its parent company, Universal Music Group. Paul alleged that Island Def Jam was \"negligent in its obligation to obtain clearance and proper licensing for any copyrighted material\" used on the album. In February 2006, a superior court judge ruled that Paul's attorneys had failed to file a sworn declaration in the given period of time, but allowed them to file an amended complaint. Paul's lawyers amended the countersuit and added Milian as a defendant, saying that she was also negligent and that she should compensate him for money he spent in the copyright action. In June 2006, Universal Music Group filed a breach-of-contract suit against Milian and Paul. The record label claimed it was forced to pay attorney fees as a result of the litigation between Milian and Paul. The suit also said that Paul owes the company attorneys' fees from an earlier federal court case involving \"Dip It Low\".\n\nParagraph 21: Moving to Walford with her grandchildren in 2002, Nana's family become worried when she starts to become overly forgetful. It is suspected that she has Alzheimer's disease, but it turns out to be water on the brain, which is operated on with no lasting cognitive effects. Nana meets a pensioner, Wilfred Atkins (Dudley Sutton), while on holiday at the seaside. They plan to marry, but on their wedding day Alfie exposes him as a fraud as he plans to flee with some of Victoria's possessions. She is devastated, and Wilfred leaves Walford having conned Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) out of £30,000. In 2005, Nana is diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm, and takes the decision to die, as her chances of surviving an operation were low due to her age (84). She works on a wish list of things she wants to do before her death, such as getting arrested, playing poker, to have tea with the Queen and to visit her dead husband's grave in Normandy. Alfie takes her to France to fulfill one of her wishes on Armistice Day 2005. Nana lays flowers on William's grave and tells him she will see him very soon. Alfie's emotional state is badly affected by Nana's deteriorating health. As Christmas 2005 approached, the strain and stress on Alfie escalates. Still determined to do whatever his grandmother wishes, he tries to enjoy what he knew would be his final days with her. Per one of her wishes, Alfie buys Nana a battery-operated, dancing toy snowman and helps her decorate the Moon house for Christmas. As Nana and Alfie sit, watching the dancing snowman, the batteries run out. Alfie turns to his grandmother and is heartbroken to see that she has peacefully died on the sofa.\n\nParagraph 22:  In Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory alternate history series (American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold and American Empire: The Victorious Opposition), Herbert Hoover was initially elected vice president in 1932 on the Democratic ticket with Calvin Coolidge. Despite the prosperity of the country under Socialist President Upton Sinclair after the Great War (1914–1917), the fortunes of the country had fallen dramatically under Sinclair's successor, Hosea Blackford. The strong stock market which had characterized most of the 1920s had finally crashed in 1929. President Blackford was unable to deal satisfactorily with the resulting depression. In 1932, the United States found itself in the Pacific War against the Empire of Japan. While the war was largely a stalemate on the ocean, Japan ran a successful air-raid on the city of Los Angeles on the very day that Blackford was in-town for a rally. Thus, when Hoover was nominated to be Coolidge's running mate, the Democrats were in the strongest position they had been in for over a decade. Coolidge defeated Blackford handily. However, Coolidge died on January 5, 1933, of a heart attack, less than a month before he was to take office on February 1, and so Vice President-elect Hoover became the 31st president in his stead. Although Hoover was a Democrat, his Secretary of War was Franklin D. Roosevelt, a lifelong Socialist politician in spite of being a relative of staunch Democrat Theodore Roosevelt. Despite some of the initial optimism expressed by the voters, Hoover quickly proved a disappointment. His complete contempt for \"paternalism\" in the federal government rendered him just as ill-equipped to handle the economic depression as Blackford had been. He made this opinion known when Colonel Abner Dowling, the then-military governor of Utah, proposed a make-work plan for the state. Hoover flatly refused, despite the fact that the jobless rate in Utah was further exacerbating that already-precarious situation. This stance led the voters to return the Socialists to Congress in 1934. Hoover's handling of foreign affairs also frustrated many of his supporters in the military. While he continued the policy of rearmament begun by Blackford, the Pacific War ended inconclusively in 1934. After Jake Featherston and the Freedom Party came to power in the Confederate States of America, Hoover proved indecisive in his dealings with the United States' long-time enemy. When Featherston pressed for permission to arm more troops to suppress black uprisings, Hoover (after a period of vacillation) acquiesced, justifying his decision by citing his concerns about \"radical\" elements among the black Confederate community, and naively concluding that Featherston would not use the increased military against the United States. While Hoover did stand strong against Featherston on the rebellious states of Kentucky and Houston which the United States had taken from the Confederate States following the Great War, it was too little, too late. Growing dissatisfaction with Hoover led to his defeat in 1936 at the hands of Socialist Al Smith and his running mate Charles W. La Follette, who became the 32nd President. One of Hoover's last official duties included acting as pallbearer at his predecessor Hosea Blackford's state funeral, as did former President Sinclair.\n\nParagraph 23: 2008 proved to be Van Barneveld's most barren year thus far in the PDC in terms of success, with him not winning a major tournament. His defence of the World Championship crown was seriously thwarted by a bout of flu. He managed to win his first two matches comfortably, although he nearly had to retire during his second-round match due to breathing problems. He was defeated by Kevin Painter in the 3rd round by 4 sets to 2. Following this, he reached the semi-finals of the 2008 Premier League Darts, but was defeated for the third consecutive year at this stage of the tournament, defeated by James Wade. He was also knocked out of the early stages of the US Open, the Las Vegas Desert Classic by Alan Tabern and in the semi-finals of the UK Open by Gary Mawson, after having defeated rival Taylor by 10 legs to 9 a round earlier. He was also defeated in the quarter finals of the World Matchplay by Wayne Mardle, despite leading 12 legs to 7 at one stage. However, Van Barneveld did regain some form in the World Grand Prix reaching the final of the tournament, before being defeated by Taylor by 6 sets to 2. He then lost to Lewis in the quarter-finals of the inaugural European Darts Championship in November losing by 9 legs to 2.\n\nParagraph 24: Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em was released on February 12, 1990. It features the successful single \"U Can't Touch This\", which sampled Rick James' 1981 single, \"Super Freak\". It was produced, recorded and mixed by Felton Pilate and James Earley, on a modified tour bus in 1989. Despite heavy airplay and a No. 27 chart debut, \"U Can't Touch This\" peaked at No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, because it was only released as a twelve-inch single. However, the album was a No. 1 success for 21 weeks, due primarily to this single – the first time ever for a rap recording on the pop charts. The song has been used in many movies and television shows to date, and appears on soundtrack and compilation albums as well (such as Man of the House and Back 2 Back Hits).\n\nParagraph 25: Arthur Howe Ross (January 13, 1885 – August 5, 1964) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and executive from 1905 until 1954. Regarded as one of the best defenders of his era by his peers, he was one of the first to skate with the puck up the ice rather than pass it to a forward. He was on Stanley Cup championship teams twice in a playing career that lasted thirteen seasons; in January 1907 with the Kenora Thistles and 1908 with the Montreal Wanderers. Like other players of the time, Ross played for several different teams and leagues, and is most notable for his time with the Wanderers while they were members of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and its successor, the National Hockey League (NHL). In 1911 he led one of the first organized player strikes over increased pay. When the Wanderers' home arena burned down in January 1918, the team ceased operations and Ross retired as a player.\n\nParagraph 26: Mozhaysky was born to Polish parents in Rochensalm, in the Grand Duchy of Finland (present-day Kotka), southern Finland, then part of the Russian Empire. His father was an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, and Mozhaysky graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps in 1841. He spent the next seven years on voyages in the Baltic Sea and in the White Sea on various vessels, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1849. He served with the Baltic Fleet from 1850 to 1852. In 1853 he was selected as a member of Vice Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin’s expedition to the Far East. In August 1853, he demonstrated a working model of a steam engine to various Japanese dignitaries at Nagasaki, from which Japanese inventor Tanaka Hisashige was later able to reverse-engineer a Japanese version. In December 1854 he was shipwrecked at Heda, Shizuoka when the frigate Diana sank in the 1854 Ansei-Tōkai earthquake. Mozhaysky assisted in the construction of the schooner Heda in 1855, which enabled the Russian delegation negotiating the Treaty of Shimoda to return home. Later in 1855, during the Crimean War, he served in the Gulf of Finland on the brig Antenor.\n\nParagraph 27: In 1969, Li with Joseph Fraumeni identified 24 families with a high risk of cancer throughout generations of family members. Their research and discovery in the abstract of Li and Fraumeni's paper described their method and results as, \"A search of the Cancer Family Registry of the National Cancer Institute revealed 24 kindreds with the syndrome of sarcoma, breast carcinoma, and other neoplasms in young patients. Cancer developed in an autosomal dominant pattern in 151 blood relatives, 119 (79%) of whom were affected before 45 years of age. These young patients had a total of 50 bone and soft tissue sarcomas of diverse histological subtypes and 28 breast cancers. Additional features of the syndrome included an excess of brain tumors (14 cases), leukemia (9 cases), and adrenocortical carcinoma (4 cases) before age 45 years. These neoplasms also accounted for 73% of the multiple primary cancers occurring in 15 family members. Six of these patients had second cancers linked to radiotherapy. The diversity of tumor types in this syndrome suggests pathogenetic mechanisms which differ from hereditary cancers arising in single organs or tissues. The syndrome is presently diagnosed on clinical grounds; laboratory markers are needed to identify high-risk individuals and families and to provide insights into susceptibility mechanisms that may be shared by a wide variety of cancers.\"\n\nParagraph 28: Traditionally, students were required to be members of the nation corresponding to the area from which they came. With one exception, Södermanland-Nerikes nation at Uppsala, this requirement is now voided, and students may even join more than one nation. International students are also free to choose whichever nation they desire. The nations are in charge of the sorts of social activities and venues that at other universities are handled by the student unions, fraternities, or companies: bars, clubs, theatre companies, orchestras, sports societies, and also some housing. Nations notably host gasques, themed dinner parties that are a traditional part of Swedish student life.\n\nParagraph 29: NATO Joint Military Symbology is the NATO standard for military map symbols. Originally published in 1986 as Allied Procedural Publication 6 (APP-6), NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems, the standard has evolved over the years and is currently in its fifth version (APP-6D). The symbols are designed to enhance NATO's joint interoperability by providing a standard set of common symbols. APP-6 constituted a single system of joint military symbology for land, air, space and sea-based formations and units, which can be displayed for either automated map display systems or for manual map marking. It covers all of the joint services and can be used by them.\n\nParagraph 30: During the Spider-Verse storyline, Morlun's mysterious past was revealed that he is from a universe designated Earth-001 and that Morlun and his estranged family known as the Inheritors took part in a battle against the Master Weaver and succeeded in capturing it at the cost of the life of the Inheritors unnamed matriarch. With the power of the Master Weaver, they use its power to conquer Earth-001. They then used the Master Weaver's powers to travel between dimensions and hunt all Spider-Totem avatars. Morlun, along with the Inheritors, have been shown killing several alternate universe versions of Spider-Man, some of which are witnessed by Spider-UK, a spider-themed member of the Captain Britain Corps. Spider-UK sets out to travel through the web of life in order to save all the remaining Spider-Men from the Inheritors. Later, Morlun kills Spider-Man 2099's counterpart, and as he tries to arrive on Earth-616, the portal closes and Morlun expresses fear of the Earth-616 Spider-Man following their last fight. Spider-Man 2099 leaves and warns Peter Parker to let him know what happened. Meanwhile, the Inheritors massive dinner-table laden with crippled Spider-Totems are waiting for Morlun as he returns carrying Spider-Totem. Morlun is furious with his brother, Daemos had hunting on Earth-616 tells him it is his Spider-Totem as they fight until their father, Solus, intimidates them. Solus reminds them that he has known all along where the Bride, the Other, and the Scion are located, and about a prophecy that will bring the downfall of the Inheritors. He asks his son what is his desire. Morlun responds that his wish is to be his father's chosen heir, the Great Web is his legacy and obligation. Solus corrects him stating that the Web is all things and everywhere and that it is their kingdom making them the Inheritors of all creation.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text explains that traditionally, students in Sweden were required to be members of the nation corresponding to their area. However, this requirement has been voided, and students now have the freedom to join multiple nations. This applies to international students as well. The nations take on responsibilities such as organizing social activities, managing venues, and providing housing. Gasques, which are themed dinner parties, are a significant part of Swedish student life and are hosted by the nations.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: Quakers were one of the dissenting religious groups to emerge after the English Civil War in the mid-17th century.  At that time Godalming, a centuries-old industrial town on the River Wey in the southwest of Surrey, was \"overwhelmingly Puritan in belief and practice\".  The parish was extremely large, meaning that the incumbent at the Church of England parish church (St Peter and St Paul's) saw little of his parishioners; and his Anglo-Catholic views were unpopular and out of step with the beliefs of many locals.  Therefore, by the 1660s, Nonconformist conventicles (unofficial, informal religious meetings led by laypersons) had a substantial following in Godalming.  One, which attracted up to 500 people weekly, was held at a house in Eashing (west of Godalming) belonging to the brother of a Quaker called Henry Gill.  This developed out of an earlier conventicle at Binscombe Manor on the north side of Godalming, the property of Thomas Patching.  He was converted to the Quaker cause by the preaching of the denomination's founder George Fox at Ifield in West Sussex—an early centre for the Quaker cause where a Friends meeting house (still in use) was opened in 1676.  Patching inherited Binscombe Manor in the late 1650s and held regular Quaker meetings at a barn on the estate.  A Quaker burial ground was established next to it in 1659.  Fox himself preached at Binscombe, as did other early Quaker leaders.  Describing a journey into Surrey in 1655, Fox wrote \"we passed on [from Reigate] to Thomas Patching's, of Binscombe in Godalming, where we had a meeting, to which several Friends came from London\".  Patching was arrested in 1660 for failing to pay parish tithes, and died soon afterwards.  Henry Gill, who then took up the Quaker cause at Binscombe, was arrested on the same charge and had property seized.  More Quakers were prosecuted throughout the rest of the 17th century.  Meetings later moved to the home of Ezra Gill (Henry Gill's brother), Jordans, in Eashing.  Some were also held at Henry Gill's own home, the location of which is now unknown.  Gill had in 1658 published a pamphlet entitled Warning and Visitation to the Inhabitants of Godalming which encouraged the town's residents to follow the Quaker cause.  The following year, a group of Quakers in the town \"were much beaten and abused, and put into the cage there ... for opposition to the priest\".\n\nParagraph 2: Up until the dawn of the Roman Empire, it was common for loans to be negotiated as oral contracts. In the early Empire, lenders and borrowers began to adopt the usage of a chirographum (“handwritten record”) to record these contracts and use them for evidence of the agreed terms. One copy of the contract was presented on the exterior of the chirographum, while a second copy was kept sealed within two waxed tablets of the document in the presence of a witness. Informal methods of maintaining records of loans made and received existed, as well as formal incarnations adopted by frequent lenders. These serial lenders used a kalendarium to document the loans that they issued to assist in tabulating interest accrued at the beginning of each month (Kalends). Parties to contracts were supposed to be Roman citizens, but there is evidence of this boundary being broken. Loans to citizens were also originated from public or governmental positions. For example, the Temple of Apollo is believed to have engaged in secured loans with citizens’ homes being used as collateral. Loans were more rarely extended to citizens from the government, as in the case of Tiberius who allowed for three-year, interest-free loans to be issued to senators in order to avert a looming credit crisis.\n\nParagraph 3: The New Peace Process commenced with the first Bastar Dialogue, a three-day consultation event held at Tilda Chhattisgarh on 8th June 2018. Just before the December election of 2018, combined efforts by some Left-leaning intellectuals, peace activists, non-governmental organisations and civil society and tribal leaders of Bastar were aimed at opening channels of communication between representatives of the state government and the Maoist rebels. With the central theme of the event being “Finding an alternative path”, the tribal communities caught in the crossfire were the focus of the meeting at Tilda and tribal groups from northeastern states, Andhra Pradesh-Telangana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra came down to Chhattisgarh. Self-rule/autonomy in tribal areas was discussed with emphasis on the sixth Schedule of the constitution. The Bodoland autonomous council, healthcare and educational facilities in Naxal areas and need for tribal leadership to emerge were scrutinised heavily. Among many, the key speakers included the Chairman of the National Commission of Scheduled Tribes (NCST), Nand Kumar Sai; the pioneer of peace negotiations, Prof. Haragopal; former Central Cabinet Minister, Arvind Netam; former Chhattisgarh Finance Minister, Ramchandra Singhdeo; former Madhya Pradesh Chief Secretary, Sharad Chandra Behar; Deshbandhu Chief Editor, Lalit Surjan; Prof. Madhulika Banerjee; and BPS Netam of Sarv Adivasi Samaj. Various activists and journalists also addressed the gathering and expressed their concern for violence in Central India and advocated community-based growth and peaceful living of Adivasis, Dalits and other communities.  A 200km yatra from Andhra Pradesh to Jagdalpur was proposed, symbolic of the route taken by Maoists in 1980. This non-partisan walk would facilitate dialogue as opposed to confrontation. Another key discussion point was the relevance of existing mass media platforms and cultural initiatives that are happening in Central India and how they can be mobilised further to promote peace. Two prominent initiatives were Deepa Kiran's session on storytelling, which emphasised on the need to shift the storytelling paradigm from far removed English speaking western concepts to more experience-based stories, and CGNet’s work on the democratisation of media. As per the report on proceedings of Vikalp Sangam, the 3-day event ‘engaged in understanding the various non-violent alternatives created by people in the field, such as strengthening gram sabhas under PESA; getting access to rights, privileges and dues under the Forest Rights Act (FRA); undertaking a march advocating for peace; and creating alternative models in education, health, media, agriculture and cottage industry. The Sangam was an endeavour to envision an alternative future for the Adivasis, Dalits and the poor through strengthening egalitarianism in self-rule and eco-centric development practices.’ A poll taken on the 3rd and final day of the event revealed that there were 70 people from 11 states, and a majority of people (73%) were from rural India.\n\nParagraph 4: The robust nasal bones, preserved in a single specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had a good sense of smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P. germainepetterae, but not P. madagascariensis. P. madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P. germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P. madagascariensis, but in P. germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.\n\nParagraph 5: Prior to the entrance of the United States into World War I, she served on Neutrality Patrol duty, trying to protect American and neutral-flagged merchant ships from interference by British or German warships and U-boats. In the course of performing those duties, Balch was at Newport, Rhode Island, in early October 1916. At 0530 on 8 October, wireless reports came in of a German submarine stopping ships near the Lightship Nantucket, off the eastern end of Long Island. After an SOS from the British steamer  was received at about 1230, Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves ordered Balch and other destroyers at Newport to attend to survivors. The American destroyers arrived on the scene about 1700 when the U-boat,  under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose, was in the process of stopping the Holland-America Line cargo ship . Shortly after, U-53 stopped the British passenger ship . As Rose had done with three other ships U-53 had sunk earlier in the day, he gave passengers and crew aboard Blommersdijk and Stephano adequate time to abandon the ships before sinking the pair. At one point, Rose signaled Balch requesting that she move out of the way to allow Stephano to be torpedoed, much to the later chagrin of Lord Beresford, who denounced Balchs compliance as \"aiding and abetting\" the Germans in a speech in the House of Lords. In total, 226 survivors from U-53s five victims were rescued by the destroyer flotilla. Balch picked up the crew of Stephano and a number of passengers, later transferring them to destroyer  for return to Newport.\n\nParagraph 6: Other than the UEFA-affiliated Royal Belgian Football Association, several amateur football leagues exist in Belgium, most at regional levels. These are often called \"pub teams' leagues\", although this is not entirely correct: far from all clubs represent a pub, as often there are teams enrolled who represent a town or district of a village, a company or another institution. Many amateur leagues exist in Belgium, most of them are region-bound or province-bound. Examples of amateur leagues with a long tradition include the KVV (Koninklijke Vlaamse Voetbalbond) organising provincial leagues in all Flemish provinces save for West-Vlaanderen; the MTSA for the area Dendermonde-Aalst-Denderstreek; the LVVB Melle for the area Wetteren-Ghent (with some clubs outside this area); the LVV Meetjesland for the Meetjesland area and few clubs from Ghent, the Corporative Leagues in several provinces mainly intended for company teams (although sometimes also including general amateur teams), the WALIVO in the Waasland area, the ABSSA and Travailliste leagues in Brussels and surrounding areas, … The system is complex as some of these regional leagues are affiliated to the Belgian FA (sometimes their member clubs receive a matricule number) but the leagues are totally separate from the league system in the leagues directly run by the Belgian FA (described above). Some other amateur leagues operate totally separate from the Belgian FA with no connection to the Belgian FA in any ways. Amateur leagues are in decline in some areas due to the competition from the general Belgian FA-run leagues and due to long travel distances being unpractical at amateur level. Several clubs who started in amateur leagues have made the transfer to the leagues run directly by the Belgian FA (starting at the lowest level). Some of these clubs even managed to, after a while, reach a relatively high level of the Belgian pyramid. Many amateur leagues in the past were tied to a political ideology, and Catholic, Socialist and Liberal amateur leagues existed. Nowadays most amateur leagues are based upon geographic area rather than on political ideologies.\n\nParagraph 7: Fleck wrote that the development of truth in scientific research was an unattainable ideal as different researchers were locked into thought collectives (or thought-styles). This means \"that a pure and direct observation cannot exist: in the act of perceiving objects the observer, i.e. the epistemological subject, is always influenced by the epoch and the environment to which he belongs, that is by what Fleck calls the thought style\". Thought style throughout Fleck's work is closely associated with representational style. A \"fact\" was a relative value, expressed in the language or symbolism of the thought collective in which it belonged, and subject to the social and temporal structure of this collective. He argued, however, that within the active cultural style of a thought collective, knowledge claims or facts were constrained by passive elements arising from the observations and experience of the natural world. This passive resistance of natural experience represented within the stylized means of the thought collective could be verified by anyone adhering to the culture of the thought collective, and thus facts could be agreed upon within any particular thought style. Thus while a fact may be verifiable within its own collective, it may be unverifiable in others. He felt that the development of scientific facts and concepts was not unidirectional and does not consist of just accumulating new pieces of information, but at times required changing older concepts, methods of observations, and forms of representation. This changing of prior knowledge is difficult because a collective attains over time a specific way of investigating, bringing with it a blindness to alternative ways of observing and conceptualization. Change was especially possible when members of two thought collectives met and cooperated in observing, formulating hypothesis and ideas. He strongly advocated comparative epistemology. He also notes some features of the culture of modern natural sciences that recognize provisionality and evolution of knowledge along the value of pursuit of passive resistances. This approach anticipated later developments in social constructionism, and especially the development of critical science and technology studies.\n\nParagraph 8: Besides the Battle of Ballinamuck, two at the Cape, and three in South America, Sir Robert was present at the Battle of Corunna, the passage of the Douro, the battle of Busaco, the lines of Torres Vedras, the siege and reduction of Olivenza, the first siege of Badajoz, the battle of Albuera, the siege and storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, the third siege and storming of Badajoz, the battles of the Nivelle, Nive, passage of the Adour, and the battles of Orthes and Toulouse. He received the gold cross and three clasps for Busaco, Albuera, Badajoz, Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and the war medal and two clasps for Corunna and Ciudad Rodrigo. He also received Portuguese and Spanish orders, including the special star given by the Portuguese government to all English officers of superior rank engaged at Albuera. He brought home the despatches regarding Albuera, and on that occasion was appointed a brevet lieutenant-colonel. He was created a knight of the Tower and Sword by the government of Portugal, and in 1815 was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In 1830, he attained the rank of major-general, and in 1838 was appointed to the command of the troops in Ceylon, after which he commanded a division in Bengal until his promotion as lieutenant-general in 1841. In 1843, he was appointed colonel of the 76th Foot.\n\nParagraph 9: Forbes gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying, \"It's fun enough to make its shortcomings less important, though certainly not to overlook them entirely.\" Toronto Sun gave it a favorable review and called it \"a must-buy if you already own a Vita, and with its release there's never been a better moment to pick one up.\" Digital Spy similarly gave it four stars out of five and called it \"one of the deepest and most interesting games available for Sony's handheld. The dark fantasy style and slightly repetitive missions might put some people off, but if you're looking to invest a lot of time into a game and don't mind sacrificing your social life, Keiji Inafune's latest is just the game for you.\" The Escapist likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated, \"While the game is a little limited by the platform, the underlying mechanics will capture a certain style of player.\" However, 411Mania gave it a score of 7.4 out of 10, saying, \"Repetitive missions aside, Soul Sacrifice is a worthwhile experience on the Vita. I find myself coming back to the game to get new weapons and run bosses with friends. It's an enjoyable experience that gets better as you get stronger, and may be a good title for a lot of Vita owners to get back into the handheld.\" Slant Magazine gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \"a game that's most arresting when experienced alone, its grim story one of intensifying emptiness and detachment. Regardless of its irregular pratfalls, there's something to be said for a title this dark that excels primarily in short bursts rather than prolonged, daylight-avoiding tests of mental pertinacity.\" The Digital Fix likewise gave it seven out of ten and said that the game \"can stand on its own feet proudly, but it’s the potential of the birth of a franchise that should get gamers everywhere smiling into their Mountain Dew.\" Edge gave it a score of six out of ten and called it \"a brave game that dares to weaken players in one way as it empowers them in another. Concept may be wrong in thinking Monster Hunter would be better if it was just about hunting monsters, but Soul Sacrifice is courageous and thematically bold enough to distinguish itself from the clones that have followed in the wake of Capcom's phenomenon.\"\n\nParagraph 10: In 2010, he won his second World Poker Tour title by winning the WPT Doyle Brunson Five Diamond World for over $870,000. On July 3, 2012, he won the largest buy-in tournament in history, the Big One for One Drop, a $1,000,000 buy-in live event. After beating 47 other players, he earned $18,346,673, the biggest cash prize in poker history. The same year at the 2012 World Series of Poker Europe, Esfandiari won his third bracelet in the €1,100 No Limit Hold'em event, defeating Remi Bollengier heads-up to earn €126,207. In the 2013 World Series of Poker, he placed fourth in the One Drop High Roller tournament, the successor to the Big One that he had won a year earlier, and earned $1,433,438.\n\nParagraph 11: Ethnographer and linguist Juan Bautista Rael collected a tale from a Spanish-language teller from North America. In this tale, titled Pájaro Verde (\"Green Bird\"), a girl asks her widowed father to marry their old woman neighbour. He does, and the old woman takes her daughter to live with them. Some time later, the man has to go on a journey, and asks what he can get them. His own daughter asks him for the \"rosario de Valoria\" (rosary of Valoria), per her stepmother's advice, which lies in a dangerous place surrounded by lions and tigers. Despite the danger, her father brings it to her, who gives to her stepmother. Later that night, the stepmother cuts off pieces of clothes and gives to the girl to sew in one night. The girl cannot do it, and summons Pájaro Verde (\"Green Bird\") to help her, on the pretense she will talk to him. A little bird comes and fulfills the task for her, despite her not addressing him. The next night, the stepmother gives the girl another pile of clothes to sew, but she cannot do the task, and leaves home. She meets some king's launderesses and are welcomed by them. They go to a ball at the king's castle, the girl wearing a veil. The prince goes to meet the veiled girl and asks her to marry him, but she says she cannot do so. The prince then tells his father the veiled girl boasted she could fill bottles with bird tears. The king gives her some bottles and threatens to kill her if she does not fulfill the task. The next day, the girl summons Pájaro Verde again; the little bird comes and tells her to summon the birds by saying Pájaro Verde wants to marry. The little birds come and cry over the bottles. A second ball is held at the castle; she wears a veil, meets the prince and refuses his romantic advances. In retaliation, the prince tells his father she can find them the \"puches\" that are used to raise the princes. The next time, she summons Pájaro Verde again; he comes and advises her on how to proceed: she is to ask for a river of crystalline water to open up and let her pass, exchange the correct fodder for animals (bone for a dog, hay for a horse), pass by an orchard of trees with fruits and not eat them, enter a witch's house, get the box and run back. The girl follows the instructions to the letter and meets the witch, whom she asks for a glass of water. While the witch is distracted, the girl takes the box lying on a stove and flees. The witch appears and commands the trees, the animals and the river to stop her, but they remain still. At a distance, she gets curious and opens the box of puches: little birds fly out of it. The girl begs for Pájaro Verde to come and help her, he appears and, uttering a spell, commands the birds to fly back into the box. The girl delivers the box to the king. Lastly, there is a third ball at the castle, where Pájaro Verde (the prince's name) will choose a bride. The girl attends again and Pájaro Verde chooses her.\n\nParagraph 12: Norris was returned again for Rye at the 1715 British general election. With the new Whig Administration, he returned to active service.  He was sent with a fleet to the Baltic Sea to support a coalition of naval forces from Russia, Denmark and Hanover taking in the Great Northern War. Tsar Peter took personal command of the coalition fleet and appointed Norris as his deputy in 1716: together they protected British and other allied merchant vessels from attack by warships of the Swedish Empire. Norris joined the Board of Admiralty led by the Earl of Berkeley in March 1718. In November 1718, following the death of Charles XII of Sweden, Britain switched sides and Norris returned to the region to protect British merchant shipping from attack by Russian raiders. Norris also acted as a commissioner in the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Nystad which ended the War in September 1721. At the 1722 British general election, he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Portsmouth. and was advanced to Senior Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board in June 1727 but stood down as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty when the Walpole–Townshend Ministry fell in May 1730.\n\nParagraph 13: The crystals used for structure study were acquired at the Daye Mine (Hawthorne et al., 2004). To get a first general idea of the mineral structure it went through X-ray intensity data analysis and then, for a more detailed study, an electron microprobe was used (Hawthorne et al., 2004). Hubeite is triclinic (P1*). Basically, there are two Ca sites in the structure of hubeite, with site one being and octahedron and the second site is coordinated by 6 oxygen atoms at the same distance and one extra oxygen atom further out and arranged in an augmented octahedron (Hawthorne et al., 2004). There are also 4 sites for Si in tetrahedral arrangement, and the fourth site bonds to an OH group forming an acid-silicate group (SiO3(OH)) (Hawthorne et al., 2004). There are 2 oxygen sites that connect 2 Si atoms, thus creating a sorosilicate (Hawthorne et al., 2002). [Si4O13] corresponds to a four membered chain fragment of tetrahedra according to Hawthorne et al. (2004). The only other sorosilicate mineral that has that same four membered configuration is ruizite (Moore et al., 1985). The main difference of the two minerals is the valence of Mn and the existence of Fe3+ for Hubeite (Hawthorne et al., 2002). Ruizite is of the [Si4O13] sorosilicate group (Hawthorne, 1984) and when it was discovered, it did not much any other Ca-Mn silicate already known (Willams et al., 1977), and now with the discovery of hubeite it is easier to understand the [Si4O13] sorosilicate group. The other two sites left in the hubeite structure are filled with Fe with CN=6 and Mn with CN=6, being one of the bonds to OH in the Mn case. The structure of hubeite is heteropolyhedra, with alternating layers of tetrahedra and different polyhedra parallel to (001) (Hawthorne et al., 2004). The tetrahedral layers are formed by [Si4O13] sharing corners, and the other alternating layer is formed by the [6], [7] and [8] Ca, Mn2+ and Fe3+ polyhedral sharing edges (Hawthorne et al., 2004). This last feature is what relates hubeite to the akatoreite group. Akatoreite, like hubeite, is triclinic with space group P1*(Burns et al., 1993). Akatoreite’ structure is layered as well with alternating sheets of octahedra and tetrahedra, parallel to (101) (Burns et al., 1993). The octahedra groups, as well as one Mn tetrahedra group, are sharing edges and linked by the corner sharing tetrahedral. The same happens in ruizite, except that they are linked by the [Si4O13] group. The inesite structure also relates very well to the hubeite structure. It is also based on layers of edge sharing polyhedra alternating with corner sharing tetrahedra (Hawthrone et al., 2004). The main difference is that inesite is a cyclosilicate, and in fact, by omitting 2 of the 6 tetrahedra that form the tetrahedra ring, and if the other 8 membered ring is broken and hydroxylated, the new arrangement becomes a hubeite (Hawthorne et al., 2004). This just confirms the association of hubeite and inesite in the Daye mines (Hawthorn et al., 2004).\n\nParagraph 14: In September 1999, the Federal CIO Council published the \"Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework\" (FEAF) Version 1.1 for developing an Enterprise Architecture (EA) within any Federal Agency for a system that transcends multiple inter-agency boundaries. It builds on common business practices and designs that cross organizational boundaries, among others the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model. The FEAF provides an enduring standard for developing and documenting architecture descriptions of high-priority areas. It provides guidance in describing architectures for multi-organizational functional segments of the Federal Government. At the time of release, the Government's IT focus on Y2K issues and then the events of September 2001 diverted attention from EA implementation, though its practice in advance and subsequent to this may have ameliorated the impact of these events. As part of the President's Management Agenda, in August 2001, the E-Government Task Force project was initiated (unofficially called Project Quicksilver). A key finding in that strategy was that the substantial overlap and redundant agency systems constrained the ability to achieve the Bush Administration strategy of making the government \"citizen centered\". The Task Force recommended the creation a Federal Enterprise Architecture Project and the creation of the FEA Office at OMB. This was a shift from the FEAF focus on Information Engineering, to a J2EE object re-use approach using reference models comprising taxonomies that linked performance outcomes to lines of business, process services components, types of data, and technology components. Interim releases since that time have provided successive increases in definition for the core reference models (see below), as well as a very robust methodology for actually developing an architecture in a series of templates forming the Federal Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM) and its next generation replacement, the Collaborative Planning Methodology (CPM), which was designed to be more flexible, more widely applicable, and more inclusive of the larger set of planning disciplines.\n\nParagraph 15: Aaren is a bisexual tycoon. His father is part of a famous toy production company and cared a great deal about family image. When Aaren developed a homosexual relationship with a male friend, he kept it secret until he wanted to force his hand to come out. He killed his boyfriend and buried him over a secluded area in the hills. Only he knew about the secret and for several years he lived life quietly and started a relationship with Ying after she broke up with Johnlung. Ying became Aaren's confidant, but eventually his mix of lies and truths became apparent and Ying warned Johnlung about Aaren's suspicious past (without knowing he killed his boyfriend). Aaren was angry that she suspected him and would tell off someone about their secrets and so Aaren tried to kill Ying. They would put up a struggle until they both fell into the ocean and Aaren tried to drown Ying. Because witnesses came, Aaren used this excuse that he tried to commit suicide and that Ying tried to save him, but ended up injured herself. Johnlung didn't accept that as the truth, but because Ying is in a coma the truth would never come. Aaren planned to kill her by transferring her to a private hospital where he's able to act without too many witnesses, but she died. It wasn't long that Johnlung discovered that a Thai man was taping the local area and had the very tape the clearly displayed Aaren's murderous intent. Johnlung and Aaren would eventually play a game of how much they can't hurt each other by making personal attacks on each other's families. Johnlung would deliver a disk of the actual murder to Aaren's father, leading to a heart attack. Aaren would distract Johnlung's nephew to look like he was kidnapped. Eventually Aaren was kidnapped by his own brother, Tim, who desperately needed money. After the drop was made though, Tim friends wanted to kill Aaren. Johnlung was part of the investigating group over Aaren's apparent kidnap and Johnlung took the opportunity to kill Aaren after he mocked him for unable the finish the job and that the heavens was so good to him. Aaren's true death would eventually come into light after Johnlung turned his ways and confessed his crimes. Although Aaren's true death was revealed, only his family missed him as everyone knows him as the disturbed killer that he is.\n\nParagraph 16: In September 2014, talking about whether the ending of the season would also be a satisfying end to the series, Bell said \"we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [to season 2] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer.\" He also talked about whether the themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying \"What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor.\" Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying \"In many ways, the whole metaphor at the heart of the show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position.\" Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that \"We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths.\" Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, \"She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity.\"\n\nParagraph 17: Leela arrives to visit Tegan after she gives birth to a surprise baby. She agrees to move in with her parents and meets her half-brother Ste. In trying to help Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) to find her daughter, Leela revealed that Peri was not her sister but her daughter. She admits that she gave birth young and her parents agreed to be parents to her. She finally tells Peri that she is her mother and Peri rejects her. Leela's ex Cameron Campbell (Cameron Moore) arrives in Hollyoaks and tries to win her back, but at the time she was with Ziggy Roscoe (Fabrizio Santino). In 2015, Leela married Ziggy. Peri becomes pregnant at 15 by Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins), and later gives birth to a baby girl called Steph, making Leela a grandmother at 28. Ziggy dies on Christmas Eve 2015 after suffering a head injury in an explosion a day before leaving Leela heartbroken. Leela later falls pregnant. Leela is horrified when Peri goes missing and it is revealed that Nico kept her hostage in a bunker. Peri reveals this to them at the hospital and a furious Cameron vows revenge. He starts a fire which kills Nico but it also kills Ziggy's brother Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan), after an explosion causes him to fall from a ferris wheel. A few weeks later, Cameron proposes to Leela and she happily accepts. Celine McQueen (Sarah George) discovers that Cameron started the fire so Cameron kills her to keep his secret. At Leela's hen party, Tegan pays Zack Loveday (Duayne Boachie) to be the stripper and an angry Cameron punches him. The guilt of Cameron's crimes becomes too much for him, so he writes a confession letter and leaves. Leela panics when he disappears so his cousin Courtney Campbell (Amy Conacham) tricks him into meeting her at the hospital. He tries to confess his crimes but Courtney persuades him to return to Leela. Leela finds his confession letter but only reads the first page before rushing off to the ceremony and Cameron burns it. After saying their vows, Leela goes into labour two months early. She gives birth to a baby boy but the baby is struggling to breathe. Cameron spots a bruise on the baby's leg and angrily accuses the staff of harming his child. Leela names the baby Daniel after her father. While they are alone, Tegan tells Leela that it was a Mongolian blue spot which is common in mixed race babies, meaning Cameron isn't the father. Leela tells Cameron that he isn't the father and he makes her choose between him or the baby and Leela chooses him. The baby's father is revealed to be Louis Loveday (Karl Collins) whose son Zack was the main suspect.\n\nParagraph 18: In a review for The Boston Phoenix, Michael Christopher speculated that the album would be received poorly by those who refuse to recognize the Misfits as legitimate without Glenn Danzig. \"The problem is, and has always been, that it just isn't the Misfits without Glenn Danzig at the helm\", he elaborated in the Delaware County Daily Times, \"[Only] retains the name in rights only, because there is no true legitimacy left within the group, which has featured a revolving door of backup players.\" \"That's a shame, because The Devil's Rain is chock full of good, campy horror business.\" He gave the album a mixed review in both publications, praising some tracks while criticizing others: Unexplained', 'Vivid Red', and 'Sleepwalkin' ' are fun and frightfully ferocious. Other points are stumbles: 'Monkey's Paw' has Only trying pitifully hard to ape the Misfits' 'Last Caress', and tracks like 'Curse of the Mummy's Hand' and 'Ghost of Frankenstein' are too predictable to be more than schlock, though it would be funny—in a good, goofy, send-up sort of way—if it was done under another moniker ... These guys just need another alias.\" Gentile expressed similar sentiments, complementing Only's bass and Cadena's guitar playing but saying that the group's choice to continue under the Misfits name seemed to limit their choice of subject matter: \"while the band has technical chops, it almost seems like they are singing about the occult and undead merely because that's what the Misfits are supposed to do. When original vocalist Glenn Danzig detailed 'the insemination of little girls in the middle of wet dreams', it seemed like that was something he was actually into. Even when second Misfits vocalist, Michael Graves, wailed that he was 'crying on a Saturday night', it seemed he was pulling from true early 20s dejection. But, when Only sings about mummies, or Frankenstein, or even hell, it doesn't seem like that's what he feels is important, but what he is limited to in subject matter, leaving the tunes without any sense of conviction.\" He did note that \"when the band does become most alive is when they play the style of music that excites them\", citing Only's doo-wop style in \"The Black Hole\" as an example. \"The Devil's Rain certainly isn't a disgrace\", he concluded, \"and long-running fans will find at least a few things to enjoy about the album. It's just frustrating that when the band snaps together and plays what they truly want to play, they aren't so much 'the Misfits' as a band containing a hefty amount of punk talent and experience. Instead of leaving the past behind, they seem to cling to it, forever condemning themselves to comparisons of previous incarnations.\" Lymangrover opined similarly, saying the album \"suffers from the fact that the group never tries to expand on the vocabulary established 30 years ago. If Famous Monsters was a step back for the Misfits legacy, this is a bigger step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nParagraph 19: Van Breda Kolff's success in college attracted the attention of the NBA. The Lakers hired him in 1967, and in his first season guided the team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in six games. In his second campaign for the Lakers, his team — with Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, and Wilt Chamberlain — notched a 55–27 record and reached the Finals again, but van Breda Kolff and Chamberlain did not get along at all (the coach thought his star center was spoiled and openly favored Baylor and West over him, while Chamberlain viewed his coach as a loser and barely tolerated him). Van Breda Kolff took tremendous flak for not allowing Chamberlain back in the game for the final minutes of game 7 of the NBA finals against Boston. Chamberlain picked up his fifth foul midway through the fourth quarter, and shortly thereafter asked out of the game with knee pain. With backup center Mel Counts in the game, the Lakers cut a seven-point deficit to two points. Chamberlain then motioned to van Breda Kolff that he was ready to go back in the game, to which van Breda Kolff told him \"sit your big ass down\" and \"we don't need you.\" The Lakers lost by two points, and van Breda Kolff resigned before he could be fired by Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke. Game 7 marked the last time he would coach an NBA team in a postseason game.\n\nParagraph 20: In 1915, two San Francisco arts patrons, Oliver and Isabel Stine, intending to build a summer retreat, purchased the  site on which Hakone now stands. Inspired by the Panama–Pacific International Exposition and her subsequent 1916 trip to Japan, Isabel Stine modeled the gardens upon (and named them after) Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. She hired Japanese landscape artists and architects to design the gardens (credited to Naoharu Aihara) and the Upper \"Moon Viewing\" House (credited to Tsunematsu Shintani). Construction proceeded between 1917 to 1929. In 1923, the west coast premiere of Puccini's Madama Butterfly was held in the gardens; Isabel Stine was a co-founder and patron of the producing company, the San Francisco Opera.\n\nParagraph 21: In the antimatter universe, however, young Bruce was killed along with his mother, while his brother and father survived, with Thomas Jr. growing up to be Owlman. Equipping himself with a utility belt containing technology and weapons similar to those used by Batman along with possessing a drug-enhanced high intellect (devoted to crime rather than serving the law), Owlman became a master criminal and an ally to Boss Gordon (the antimatter Earth's version of James Gordon) and underboss Lucius Fox. Later, he learned that his father Thomas Wayne Sr. was still alive and had become the chief of police in their world's version of Gotham City, gathering a cadre of police officers who did not give in to the rampant corruption which infested their version of Earth. Thomas Jr. blames his father for the deaths of his mother and brother and it is strongly hinted that the main purpose to his criminal career is to punish his father, who is well aware of who he is and is equally determined to destroy his own son. During his visit to the \"main\" DC Universe upon discovering the Waynes' graves, he states that nothing matters because \"he's dead\", and that there is no one left to hurt, referring to Thomas Wayne Sr. and collapses to his knees in despair in front of his father’s grave.\n\nParagraph 22: Due to a rule change in eligibility that allowed men's and women's teams to compete in the mixed doubles discipline, over fifty teams registered in this years championship, a huge increase from the five that competed in 2020. After the qualifiers, the field was narrowed down to just thirty-one teams, and thirty once one team had to drop out. Like the men's and women's championships, the event was scheduled to be held in three rounds. The first round was held in a triple-knockout bracket, which qualified eight teams for the playoffs and the second round. Kim Min-ji and Lee Ki-jeong (Gangwon A) won the first round, qualifying through the A Event and going undefeated en route to winning the round. They defeated Jang Yeong-seo and Jeong Byeong-jin (Seoul Federation), who had also qualified through the A-side 10–0 in the final. Two C Event qualifiers made up the third place game, with Shin Ga-yeong and Park Jun-ha (Jeonbuk B) winning the game 10–3 over reigning mixed doubles champions Kim Ji-yoon and Moon Si-woo (Gyeonggi D). Kim Su-ji and Kim Jeong-min (Gyeonggi C), Yang Tae-i and Lee Ki-bok (Gangwon C), Um Min-ji and Nam Yoon-ho (Jeonbuk A) and Kim Hye-rin and Seong Yu-jin (Gangwon B) all advanced to the second round as well. Round 2 was held in a round robin between the eight qualifying teams. Through the second round, Kim Min-ji and Lee Ki-jeong dominated the field, winning all seven of their games. This meant that no third round was needed as Kim and Lee had won both the first and second round, scoring all ten available points. Yang Tae-i and Lee Ki-bok finished second through the round with a 5–2 record, earning themselves four points. As they had gotten one point from the first round, they finished the tournament with five points, which was tied with Seoul Federation and Gyeonggi D in second place. However, due to Kim and Moon having the worst Draw Shot Challenge of the three teams, they finished in fourth. Gangwon C and Seoul Federation then played a second place game to determine the national team backup, with the team from Seoul coming away as 6–5 winners. Shin Ga-yeong and Park Jun-ha finished in fifth place with four points, followed by Um Min-ji and Nam Yoon-ho in sixth with three points and Kim Hye-rin and Seong Yu-jin tied with Kim Su-ji and Kim Jeong-min in seventh with eight points.\n\nParagraph 23: In 1772, Sacchini moved to London, accompanied by Giuseppe Millico, one of the finest castrati then active on the European stage and Gluck's favourite. Beginning with two new operas staged at the King's Theatre in 1773, Il Cid (in January) and Tamerlano (in May), in the words of Burney, Sacchini soon \"captured the hearts\" of the London public. He was so popular that Tommaso Traetta was unable to make any impression with his operas when he arrived in the British capital in 1776, even though Sacchini himself had supported the move by his old friend. Sacchini remained in London for a decade, until 1782, despite the fact his enormous mounting debts created growing difficulties and even enemies. Among the latter was Venanzio Rauzzini, who had taken over from Millico as the leading male singer at the King's Theatre, and who claimed that he had written some of Sacchini's most famous arias himself. The majority of Sacchini's chamber music dates from his years in London. As far as music for the stage is concerned, new operas by Sacchini were produced every year over the whole period apart from 1776/1777, probably in connection with the composer's trips to the Continent and with the staging in Paris of French-language pasticci based on two previous works: the dramma giocoso from the Roman period, L'isola d'amore, now entitled La colonie, and the opera seria L'Olimpiade, which became L'Olympiade. The translator of the libretti into French was the musician and writer Nicolas-Étienne Framery, a lover of Italian music. At that time, the Parisian operatic scene was divided between supporters of the German composer Gluck, famous for his musical reforms, and followers of his Italian rival Niccolò Piccinni. A member of the emerging Piccinnist faction, Framery also admired Sacchini and formed a lasting friendship with him. On 8 June 1779, a work by Sacchini appeared for the first time on the stage of the Paris Opéra. It was a revival of the dramma giocoso L'amore soldato, which had premiered in England the previous year, and was now advertised as an intermède in three acts. During his stays in Paris in the seventies Sacchini is also said to have imparted the rudiments of a real singing education to the future European star of opera and refined cantatrice, Brigida Banti.\n\nParagraph 24: Chaminade College Preparatory School is an independent, Roman Catholic school, of the Marianist Order, for boys in grades six through twelve in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis. The school is located in Creve Coeur, in west St. Louis County, Missouri. The school offers 7-day, 5-day, and temporary boarding. Students come from throughout the United States and from countries throughout the world. Canning Hall, the name of the dormitory, accommodates up to sixty-five residents. The school bears the name of Father William Joseph Chaminade, a priest who lived during the era of the French Revolution and who founded the religious order known as the Society of Mary (Marianists). The school maintains an active relationship with the Society of Mary through governance structures and the employment of lay and religious Marianists and maintaining this charism.\n\nParagraph 25: With the exception of the title track, a thinly veiled ode to smoking marijuana, most of the album's material consists of traditional romance ballads and love songs, in the style of classic soul music. The lyrical content of the album closer, \"Higher\", combines the spiritual love of God and the carnal love of a woman, and is similar to the lyricism of Prince, who has been noted by music writers for exploring the \"eternal dichotomy\" of spirituality and sexuality. Music writers have noted the lyrical \"openness\" of the album, along with qualities of honesty and \"earnestness\" in D'Angelo's songwriting, in comparison to most contemporary R&B at the time. \"Alright\" deals with the consequences of a relationship and reassurance of its security. \"Shit, Damn, Motherfucker\" was cited by Shapiro as \"the nastiest cheating song since that hoary old standard of 60s rock, 'Hey Joe'\", It features a string of emphatic interjections (the chorus line \"shit, damn, motherfucker\" describes his reaction) and rhetorical questions by the narrator after walking in on his wife and his best friend in bed together. Music critic Christopher John Farley described the chorus as a \"little like the Fuhrman tapes, with a beat\", while Mark Anthony Neal found the song to be \"drenched with Marvin Gaye’s paranoia.\"\n\nParagraph 26: The protagonist of the series, Amano Sakogami, is a happy but unlucky girl. She has a dream about being attacked by a woman in a purple kimono. She is rescued by a boy in this dream, who causes her to forget the dream. It is only when she is recruited by a club at her school that she remembers. This club is called the Kaiun Kenkyukai (Better Fortune Research Organization), a cover for the Happy Seven, seven girls who each have a different power of the Shichifukujin, the Seven Lucky Gods. There are two other female members of the club, a dog-girl and a girl with pigtails and glasses. Amano recognizes the lone male member of the club as the boy who rescued her in her dreams. When she realizes this, she appoints herself their manager, hoping that this will allow her to get closer to him. She realizes that the student council president is Happy Seven's adversary, working with the woman in the purple kimono she saw in her dream. He is one of the reasons that Magatsugami, monsters that feed on negative emotions, are being released onto the world. It is the Happy Seven's job to fight them and find people with incredibly bad luck (such as Amano) and help them improve their fortune, through praying for their problems to be solved at a stone in a forest. By praying like this, they rid the person of the Magatsugami feeding on their sadness and therefore causing their misfortune. Normally, the memory of the person with the Magatsugami would be erased so that the identities of the Seven are not revealed, but this does not work for Amano. In episode 10, Amano and her childhood friends Nene and Mimi transform into Lucky Three (three transforming magical girls similar to the Happy Seven) but Mimi and Nene's memories are erased by Kikunosuke.\n\nParagraph 27: Molecular signatures in the form of CSIs have also been used to help resolve polyphyletic distribution of three main genera within the family Pasteurellaceae: Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella. These genera demonstrate extensive polyphyly across the family, however, CSIs have been found to be consistently shared by certain species that form a monophyletic group within each respective genus.  The distribution of CSIs corresponds to sensu stricto clades of \"true\" Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella species, respectively. Since they are indicative of common ancestry, it has been postulated that the CSI distribution can be used to determine genus identity, where the species that do not share the CSI may be reclassified as a different genus. CSIs have also been found that are specific for Aggregatibacter and Mannheimia , two clinically relevant genera.\n\nParagraph 28: Male, female. Forewing length 3.8-4.0 mm. Head: frons shining ochreous-white with greenish and reddish reflections, vertex and neck tufts shining dark greyish brown with reddish gloss, lined white laterally and medially, collar shining dark greyish brown; labial palpus first segment very short, white, second segment three-quarters of the length of third, dark brown with white longitudinal lines laterally and ventrally, third segment white, lined brown laterally, extreme apex white; scape dorsally shining dark brown with a white anterior line, ventrally shining white; antenna shining dark brown with a white line from base to one-half, in apical half two white rings of two segments separated by two dark brown segments, followed towards apex by six dark brown and eight white segments at apex.

Abdomen dorsally shining yellowish brown with reddish gloss, segment six banded whitish posteriorly, ventrally shining white, anal tuft ochreous.\n\nParagraph 29: Sergio Cresto was born in New York on 19 January 1956. As an Italian American, Cresto lived in Ospedaletti, near Sanremo, away from his brother George A. Cresto in New York. He began racing in an Opel Kadett GT/E with Amedeo Gerbino. In 1979, Cresto was Tonino Tognana's co-driver in a Kadett GT/E, as well as in the more powerful Fiat 131 Abarth two years later. In 1981, Cresto and Tognana came in eight in the Italian Championship. In 1982, Cresto was co-driver with another top driver, Gianfranco Cunico, in a Fiat Ritmo 130, getting good results. The following year, Cresto again changed drivers and ended the season placing three times at the Italian national level: sixth with Michele Cinotto after the third place finishes at Targa Florio and again at Quattro Regioni in a Lancia 037) tenth with Andrea Zanussi (after finishing second at the San Marino Rally in a Lancia 037). With Zanussi, Cresto came in third at Halkidikis as well that year, a European Championship qualifying race. He competed again in the same race the following year with Carlo Capone in a Lancia 037. After a long successful season and a duel with Henri Toivonen and his Porsche, the Italians eventually won the European Championship. After Maurizio Perissinot's accident, Cresto was Attilio Bettega's co-driver for two races qualifying for the World Championship. In 1985, he raced again with Zanussi for Lancia.\n\nParagraph 30: Julie Burchill attacked the film in The Sunday Times, saying that Leigh's characters talked like lobotomised Muppets: \"sub-wittily, the way Diane Arbus's subjects look.\" And Suzanne Moore in The Guardian criticised the lethargic females whose lives Johnny routinely ruins: \"What sort of realism is this? To show a misogynist and surround him with such walking doormats has the effect, intentional or not, of justifying this behaviour.\" Lesley Sharp responded: \"There are a lot of people who don't go to art house cinemas who do have deeply troubled lives and are at risk ... We do actually live in a misogynistic, violent society and there are a lot of women in abusive relationships who find it very difficult to get out of them. And a lot of men, too.\" Coveney wrote in the film's defence: \"Is there no room for irony, for the idea that in depicting horror in the sex war an artist is exposing them, not endorsing them? And who says that Sophie is an unwilling doormat or that Louise is a doormat at all? It is clear that the latter is taking serious stock of her relationship with Johnny. She exhibits both patience and tenderness in her dealings with him, whereas she finally pulls a knife on Jeremy.\"\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nSir Robert was a highly decorated and accomplished military officer. He participated in numerous battles and campaigns, including the Battle of Ballinamuck, battles in Cape, and South America. He was present at significant events such as the Battle of Corunna, the passage of the Douro, the Battle of Busaco, the lines of Torres Vedras, and the siege and reduction of Olivenza. He played a role in the sieges and stormings of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, and fought in notable battles like the Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse. Sir Robert received multiple honors and awards, including the gold cross and various clasps for his valour in battles. The Portuguese government recognized him with the Knight of the Tower and Sword, and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a major-general and commanding troops in Ceylon. He later commanded a division in Bengal and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In 1843, he was appointed colonel of the 76th Foot.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

An arrow strikes the scout in the back while the regular soldiers fire their carbines at an unseen foe. The time jumps ahead to the present, June 25, 1964, the 88th anniversary of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Three United States Army National Guard soldiers (Connors, McCluskey and Langsford) are in a M3 Stuart tank participating in a war game near the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where General George Armstrong Custer made his last stand. Their orders coincide with the route of Custer and his men. As they follow the route, they hear strange things such as Indian battle cries and horses running when nobody is there. Connors wonders if they have somehow gone back in time. When they return, Connors reports to his Captain Dennet what occurred and is reprimanded.\n\nParagraph 2: An unnamed Boy is put in the special class at school after he attacks a classmate who teased him about the burn mark on his back. The Boy's father regularly abused him, including leaving the burn on his back by throwing an iron at him.  His mother abandoned him, and he now lives with an aunt and uncle he feels don't care anything about him. In the class, he meets Asato, a quiet boy who rarely talks. Asato's mother murdered his father and then tried to kill Asato as well.  While alone with Asato after school, the Boy hurts himself carving. Asato comes over and touches him, and half the wound leaves the boy's arm and moves to Asato's so that they are equally sharing the pain. They become friends that day, and begin exploring the depths of Asato's powers. After Asato removes a scrape from a little boy's knee, the child's mother treats them to ice cream.  At the parlor, they meet Shiho, a young woman with a burned face who hides her scars behind a mask. When a kid the Boy had pushed out of a window breaks his arm with a baseball bat, Asato takes that wound as well, but then moves it to the kid with the bat. The Boy decides Asato should move all of his wounds to his father, who is lying unconscious and dying in the hospital. Whenever gets new injuries, the Boy would take Asato there to use his father's dying body as a \"dumping ground.\" Eventually, they share the secret of Asato's powers with Shiho and she asks Asato to remove the burn for just three days so she can remember what its like to live without it. She leaves town afterward, however, and Asato sinks into a depression.  No one can stand looking at him with the scar on his face, even the Boy, so they go to the hospital to give it to the Boy's father.  However, when the arrive, they find he had just died.  The Boy cries for him, and asks Asato to move all the scars back from his father's body to him instead.  Asato says he can't and runs, and the Boy realizes Asato had never given any of the wounds to his father after all. Asato runs from through the hospital, curing everyone he touches and taking on their wounds. The Boy realizes Asato wants to die because he thinks no one wants him. Outside, he takes on the fatal wounds of an accident victim, but the Boy convinces him to give him half, just like the day they became friends, so that they could share the pain equally. The wounds are serious and both spend a long time in the hospital, but during the stay the Boy comes to the conclusion that Asato was given the power because he had a pure heart, and that he wants Asato to always know someone is there willing to share his pain.\n\nParagraph 3: The Ventrilo client and server are both available as freeware for use with up to 8 people on the same server. Rented servers can maintain up to 400 people. The Ventrilo server is available under a limited license for Microsoft Windows and macOS and is accessible on FreeBSD Kopi, Solaris and NetBSD. The client is available for Windows and macOS.  However, the macOS client is still unable to properly use most servers because of a lack of support for the sparsely used GSM codec. Flagship Industries does not offer a Linux Ventrilo client. Third party Ventrilo clients are available for mobile devices, such as Ventrilode for iPhone and Ventriloid for Android.\n\nParagraph 4: The news coverage of the event stated that the Peace Democrats were responsible for beginning the event. One such news source, from the Chicago Tribune, later reprinted in the Charleston Courier, labeled Nelson Wells as the instigator of the conflict. Most articles published from the time, insist that the whole event transpired as a more spontaneous event and was not directly prompted by any one individual. The most likely explanation is that the event occurred because a sizable presence of both Copperheads and Union soldiers had been in town that day. Also many sources speculate that a sizable portion of the participants, at least on the side of the Peace Democrats, had been drinking quite heavily all day, and this led to the outbreak that resulted in the confrontation. At any rate, the fighting only lasted a few moments. But by the time the affair was over, the Copperheads had been run out of Charleston. Rewards had been issued for the capture of any of those whom fled the scene. Included in those who left town, was John O’Hair, the leader of the Copperheads, who had been the sheriff of Coles County. Out of those killed, only two had been Copperheads, Nelson Wells and John Cooper; the other participants had been either captured or escaped. Other Union troops were called in from Mattoon to assist the soldiers fighting in Charleston, but by the time their train arrived, none of the instigators were left in the town. Fifteen prisoners were eventually held for seven months, initially in Springfield, Illinois. President Lincoln, whose father and stepmother had lived in Coles County, waived the prisoners' right to Habeas Corpus and ordered their removal to Fort Delaware in the East. He ordered their release on November 4, 1864. Two of the prisoners had been indicted for murder and were exonerated by trial in December, 1864. Twelve other Copperheads had also been indicted for murder. They were never captured, and the indictments were annulled in May 1873.\n\nParagraph 5:  At the close of 1757, after Pitt's dismissal, Shebbeare issued his sixth letter, \"in which is shown that the present grandeur of France and calamities of this nation are owing to the influence of Hanover on the councils of England.\" On 12 January 1758 a general warrant was issued against the author, printer, and publisher. On 23 January all copies of a seventh Letter were seized and suppressed. On 17 June Shebbeare was tried for libel on an information laid against him by the attorney-general, Pratt, who on this occasion admitted the right of the jury to judge of the law. During the trial, as Walpole laments, Mansfield laid it down that satires on dead kings were punishable. In summing up he declared that the Letter nearly approached high treason. On 28 Nov. Shebbeare was sentenced to a £5 fine and three years' imprisonment in King's Bench Prison, as well as having to pay a bond of £500 and find two £250 sureties for good behaviour for seven years on his release. He was also to stand in the pillory at Charing Cross on 5 December. Owing to the friendship of Arthur Beardmore, the under-sheriff, he was allowed to stand upright between the upper and lower boards of the pillory, while an Irish chairman held an umbrella over his head. At the end of an hour he retired amidst the cheers of the crowd, who had been invited by printed bills to come and see 'the British champion.' Beardmore was afterwards punished for his conduct. An anonymous squib appeared under the title Memoirs of the Pillory; being a consolatory Epistle to Dr. Shebbeare. While in prison Shebbeare received subscriptions for a history of England, and actually composed one volume, which was not published. When attacked on the subject in a letter in the Public Advertiser of 10 Aug. 1774 he excused himself chiefly on the ground of debts incurred in consequence of a lawsuit against Francis Gwyn, who had been concerned with him in the publication of an edition of Clarendon's History of the Reign of Charles II. The book, for which Shebbeare wrote a strong tory introduction, was suppressed by an injunction in chancery at the instance of the Duchess of Queensberry, and, though Shebbeare recovered expenses from Gwyn, half the sum went in costs. Notwithstanding his position, he refused to avail himself of the Insolvent Act. On his release he advocated peace with France, and attacked John Wilkes. On 29 Feb. 1764 a memorial signed by several members of parliament was presented to George Grenville in his favour, and Shebbeare was granted a pension of £200 a year. The king, in reply to Sir John Philips, who made the application, is said to have spoken of Shebbeare \"in very favourable terms.\" Almon's statement that a pension of £400 had been previously granted by Bute seems doubtful. Henceforth Shebbeare became a steady advocate of the measures of the court, and even assailed his old favourite, Pitt.\n\nParagraph 6: Millmount is a large fortified complex situated on a great mound on the South bank of the River Boyne located in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland. The fort has played a crucial part in Drogheda's history and has been a dominant feature from Norman settlement, to Cromwell's invasion to the more recent Civil War in 1922, in which the famous Martello tower was shelled and all but destroyed. Today the complex houses the Millmount Museum which houses a wide variety of artifacts of local and national importance. The complex is Drogheda's most dominant feature, clearly visible from all parts of the town. The Martello tower is affectionately known as \"The Cup and Saucer\" by locals. The whole fort is a national monument and has been designated as Drogheda's Cultural Quarter.\n\nParagraph 7: After the Flyers traded away Jeff Carter and Mike Richards in the 2011 off-season, Giroux took over the role as first line centre for the club. The trading of Richards and Carter also made him the second-longest tenured member of the Flyers. Giroux formed a new top line with Scott Hartnell and free agent acquisition Jaromír Jágr. Giroux led the League in point-scoring for much of the season, and was considered a favourite for the Hart Memorial Trophy for League MVP at the season's All-Star break. He finished the season, however, 16 points behind eventual Hart Trophy winner Evgeni Malkin. On April 13, 2012, Giroux recorded his first career hat trick during game two of the first round of the 2012 playoffs against Pittsburgh. He recorded six points during that same game, earning a Flyers record for most points during a single Stanley Cup playoff game. On May 7, 2012, Giroux received a one-game suspension for a hit to the head of New Jersey Devils forward Dainius Zubrus during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. After the Flyers were eliminated by the Devils, Giroux ended the season as both the Flyers' top regular season point-scorer (93 points) and top playoff point scorer (17 points). After the Flyers' elimination, Giroux had surgery on both of his wrists; the right to repair torn cartilage, and the left to remove bone spurs. He later claimed that Sidney Crosby had repeatedly slashed his wrists during face-offs in the first round series against Pittsburgh. At the time news of the surgery was revealed, Giroux was still the playoffs' leading point scorer, even though his team had been eliminated two weeks earlier. On June 20, 2012, Giroux was named the cover athlete for NHL 13 at the NHL awards in Las Vegas; he became the first Philadelphia Flyer on an EA Sports NHL video game cover since Eric Lindros on NHL 99.\n\nParagraph 8: Now, or so he believes, guaranteed of a fish, the cat attaches the worm to his fishing rod. The worm seemingly dips one toe into the pond, shivers and scurries up the line. However, anticipating that his catch might try something like that, the cat forces the worm back down to the hook at gunpoint. Little does the overconfident cat realize that Foghorn saw the whole thing from behind a tree and somehow managed to travel from his vantage point to a point inside the pond in a fraction of a second, because the next thing he knows, Foghorn has snatched the worm and is demanding to know \"What kept, I say, what kept you, son?\" He goes on to say that the cat ought to have realized that he isn't a fish, and that his lungs would have long since begun to \"crave air!\" Muffled burbling is heard as the cat is forced to back up into the water trough nearby and Foghorn, having dipped his own head in, continues to berate his feline enemy, not missing a beat as both reemerge. Finally, Foghorn realizes that he has to appease the cat if he wants him to stop chasing the worm. So he offers to \"draw a line and BI-SECT 'im.\" And this he does with a pen, a tree stump and an axe. Foghorn draws the line evenly, so that exactly half of the stump area is on one side and the other half on the other side, and places the worm perpendicular to the line. On the cat's side is just the head; Foghorn gets to keep all else of the worm. However, as Foghorn raises the axe to cut the worm in half, the object of both their desires scrunches up all on Foghorn's side. Foghorn states delightedly: \"Well, barbecue my hamhocks. YOUR half is gone!\" The cat tries to point out that the worm just pulled his head over to Foghorn's side, but Foghorn tells the cat, \"Don't gimme no lip, son. You gotta stick by the bargain. I'd have done the same.\" But as they argue, the worm scrunches up all in the cat's end. Foghorn states in a state of shock: \"Well, pig|hog gravy and chetlucks. MY half is gone!\" Gleefully, but at the same time respectfully, the cat tries to say that the worm pulled all his parts below his head to his own side. However, Foghorn thinks that the cat wants to question whether or not the worm was there, and so Foghorn says, \"I know what you're gonna say, son. When two halves is gone, there's nothin' left. And you're right. It's a little old worm who wasn't there. Two nothin's is nothing. That's mathematics, son. You can argue with ME, but you can't argue with figures. Two half-nothings is a whole nothin'. And I know what I'm talking about, because...\" Foghorn does not get to finish his last sentence, as the cat, finally fed up with a chicken much larger than he is, doing exactly what he accused him of (talking incessantly), screams at the other worm-pursuer to shut up. While Foghorn and the cat are arguing again, the worm, having spotted a perfect opportunity to escape, crawls off.\n\nParagraph 9: From 1921 to 1923, the Russian Civil War and a drought brought a great famine to Russia, particularly to the usually food-rich Volga region of southern Russia. America responded with nearly  of food which the Bolsheviks accepted, often as surreptitiously as possible. Sturtevant investigated potential ports of debarkation in southern Russia for the supplies soon to be shipped by the American Relief Administration. To this end, she visited Odessa, Sevastopol, Novorossiysk, Theodosia, and Yalta between early February and mid-April. Thereafter, through the end of the year, she made voyages across the Black Sea to various Russian ports in conjunction with the relief operation. She stopped at numerous other foreign ports on the voyages, including Samsun, Trebizond, and Mudanya, Turkey. From July–October, she made a round-trip voyage back to the U.S., during which she was overhauled at the New York Navy Yard and exercised out of Yorktown, Virginia. On 1 October, Sturtevant was ordered back to the eastern Mediterranean and, the following day, got underway for Gibraltar. She arrived there on the 14th and continued on to Turkey, reaching Mudania on the 27th. For the next seven months, the destroyer visited the ports of the eastern Mediterranean and those along the coast of the Black Sea. In addition to ports of call of the previous cruises, she visited Varna, Bulgaria; Mersina and Smyrna, Turkey; Piraeus, Greece; and Naples, Italy. From the latter port, she sailed for Gibraltar in late May 1923, and by 12 June was back at the Navy Yard in New York. She operated along the Atlantic seaboard through the end of the year, conducting gunnery exercises in October at the southern drill grounds off Virginia. In November, the ship paid an Armistice Day visit to Baltimore. Three days before the end of the year, Sturtevant became flagship of Division 41, Squadron 14, Scouting Fleet.\n\nParagraph 10: In New York City, however, Chase became known for his flamboyance, especially in his dress, his manners, and most of all in his studio. At Tenth Street, Chase had moved into Albert Bierstadt's old studio and had decorated it as an extension of his own art.  Chase filled the studio with lavish furniture, decorative objects, stuffed birds, oriental carpets, and exotic musical instruments. The studio served as a focal point for the sophisticated and fashionable members of the New York City art world of the late 19th century. By 1895 the cost of maintaining the studio, in addition to his other residences, forced Chase to close it and auction the contents.\n\nParagraph 11: ADF is one of the most organized and influential Christian legal interest groups in the United States based on its budget, caseload, network of allied attorneys, and connections to significant members of the political right. These include U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and high-ranking Republicans such as former vice president Mike Pence, former attorneys general William Barr and Jeff Sessions, and US Senator from Missouri Josh Hawley (husband of ADF senior counsel Erin Hawley). ADF attorneys have argued a number of cases before the Supreme Court, including cases about religion in public schools, the Affordable Care Act, the legalization of same-sex marriage, business owners' right to not provide services for same-sex marriages, and prayers before town meetings. They also wrote the model legislation for Mississippi's anti-abortion legislation, making them significant players in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the decision that overruled the fifty-year-old precedent case Roe v. Wade establishing the right to abortion.\n\nParagraph 12: Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews gave note of the album's lengthy runtime being a challenge for listeners but commended Fabolous for striking a balance between \"materialism and spiritualism\" throughout the track listing with help from his producers utilizing his \"smooth monotone flow\" in the right places, concluding that, \"I'm not yet prepared to say Fabolous is DA TRUTH or that his rhyme writing has put him into echelons anywhere near the all-time greats, but he's come a long way since his Ghetto Fabolous days. You may find Real Talk a refreshing change of pace too.\" K.B. Tindal of HipHopDX praised Fabolous for remaining consistent in delivering club bangers (\"Tit 4 Tat\"), romantic slow jams (\"Baby\") and street cuts (\"Don't Stop Won't Stop\"), saying \"There are always the pure exotic street flow wit hard punch lines to the gut that Fab delivers as well as the smoothly shaped ballads that he always dishes out the chicks. On Real Talk, Fab delivers as usual.\" Steve Jones of USA Today praised Fabolous' lyricism having more direct sharpness and maturity to elevate the record's \"brash confidence\" alongside the usual hip-hop tropes, concluding that, \"In the past, his hits have tended to lean toward female fans. But with Real Talk, he balances matters.\" Kris Ex, writing for Blender, was critical of Fabolous' lack of distinct character but praised him for being an entertaining wordsmith with a breezy yet confident flow, concluding that \"It's this tension that keeps Real Talk from being a collection of one-serving throwaways: Fabolous lands dazzling lyrical stunts while sounding like he's coasting along on cruise control.\" AllMusic's Andy Kellman gave praise to \"Breathe\" for showing \"signs of being a hip-hop classic\" but was critical of Fabolous stretching his rapping skills by unconvincingly taking on various styles and a \"mixed bag of satisfactory-to-strong crossovers\", concluding that, \"[T]here's enough quality material to help fill out a Fabolous best-of, but the touch-all-bases formula inhibits the album's potential of being any better than Ghetto Fabolous or Street Dreams.\"\n\nParagraph 13: Upon her arrival in Warsaw in September 1935, the 18-year-old Ginczanka, already notable, quickly became a \"legendary figure\" of the pre-War bohemian world of artists of Warsaw as a protégée of Julian Tuwim, the doyen of the Polish poets at the time, a connection which opened for her the doors to all the most important literary periodicals, salons, and publishing houses of the country. (Her detractors bestowed on her the sobriquet of \"Tuwim in a petticoat\", Tuwim w spódnicy; while Gombrowicz, known for inventing his own private names for all his acquaintances, monikered her \"Gina\".)  High-calibre critics, such as Karol Wiktor Zawodziński, have traced aspects of Ginczanka's lyricism to the poetic achievement of Tuwim, deemed both indefinable and inimitable but concerning primarily the renewed focus on the word, its freshness, and the ultimate conciseness of expression respective of each particular poetic image or vision treated. Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz for his part recalls that Ginczanka was \"very good\" as a poet from the first, without any initial period of incubation of the poetic talent, and  conscious of her literary prowess  kept herself apart from literary groupings, in particular wishing to distance herself publicly from the Skamander circle with which she would have normally been associated by others.  Thus for example, her frequenting of the Mała Ziemiańska café, the renowned haunt of the Warsaw literati where with gracious ease she held court at the table of Witold Gombrowicz, was memorialized in her poem \"Pochwała snobów\" (In Praise of Snobs) published in the satirical magazine Szpilki in 1937.  (The co-founder of the magazine in question, the artist Eryk Lipiński, who will play an important role in salvaging her manuscripts after the War, will name his daughter Zuzanna in memory of Ginczanka.  The other co-founder, Zbigniew Mitzner, will opine in his memoirs that Ginczanka was tied to this particular weekly magazine by the closest bonds of all the alliances that she maintained with the literary press.)  In testimony to her fame, she would sometimes be herself the subject of satirical poems and drawings published in literary periodicals, as for example in the 1937 Christmas issue of the Wiadomości Literackie where she is pictured in the collective cartoon representing the crème de la crème of Polish literature (next to Andrzej Nowicki and Janusz Minkiewicz, both holding Cupid's bows, though their arrows point discreetly away from her rather than towards).\n\nParagraph 14: John F. Tenaglia was born in South Philadelphia, February 5, 1964, to parents Frank (Francesco) and Dorothy (nee Cavella).  Born into an Italian-American family, where culture was an imbedded guide for life. Especially in education, culinary and musical arts, with firm religious aspects.  At age 8 John started violin lessons with the famed violinist and conductor Joseph Primavera of the Philadelphia Orchestra and founder of the Philadelphia Youth Orchestra. Young John had little to no interest in the instrument. In 1978, The Tenaglia Family was invited to a performance of Puccini's Madama Butterfly being presented at the Forum Theater in South Philadelphia.  The person singing Pinkerton that night was renowned tenor Frank Munafo (a graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music).  John was so inspired by Munafo's singing, he instantly knew this is what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.  Mr. Tenaglia was quoted saying; \"I felt that Frank Munafo was singing directly to me, even though there were hundreds in the audience!\" Having minimal musical training at this age and limited knowledge of opera, the young man instinctively started listening to recordings found in his families house of Mario Lanza, Mario Del Monaco, Beniamino Gigli and Richard Tucker. This also encouraged him to join local church choirs where he could learn more about the art of singing.  Inevitably, for the 13-year-old, nature took its course and John was no longer able to imitate these wonderful tenors.  Dejected, he thought he'd never be able to sing like his idol Frank Munafo. His church choir director told him he should start singing in the baritone and bass sections. As John entered junior high he became a member of the choir at Thomas Junior High School. This is where Mr. Tenaglia met his soon-to-be mentor William Yeats. Mr. Yeats was also a renowned tenor (a graduate of Indiana University and Curtis Institute of Music) and the choir director at South Philadelphia High School. Mr. Yeats, would go around to all the local junior high schools to recruit talent for his high school choir.  Mr. Yeats recognized talent in Mr. Tenaglia but said nothing to the youngster until he officially became a student of the famous South Philadelphia High School. John had no idea of the background and caliber of his teacher.  One afternoon as John was on his way to his next class, when he heard what he thought was a recording playing of Che gelida mania from La Bohème.  As John looked into the room from where the music was coming, here it was William Yeats accompanying himself and singing the aria in preparation for an upcoming concert.  Tenaglia quietly snuck in the room.  Standing there, listening as Mr. Yeats continued to sing the aria as tears ran down the face of the young student, stunned from the sheer beauty of Mr. Yeats's singing.  John moved to find a comfortable standing position as a book fell off the desk behind him. Mr. Yeats turned around startled, yelled at him and said; \"what are you doing in here?!  You're Not Supposed to be in here!!\"  Tenaglia's answer was; \"why are you singing that, you're not Italian!\"  They both looked at each other and instantly broke into laughter.  That is the moment their father, son relationship began. Mr. Yeats explained to John, that he had a talent. So he offered him a deal.  \"If John promised to take music seriously and pursue it as his career, he in turn offered him free voice lessons every day after school for his remaining time at South Philadelphia High School all free of charge!\" There was one catch, Tenaglia had to promise him, that one day he would also give back this service to a young promising student.\n\nParagraph 15: The Vampire Nation has gathered its forces for an assault on Utopia. Cyclops has prepared his defenses for this attack: only the literally tough-skinned X-Men for combat, while the others remain inside the compound; the Archangel has prepped himself for air defense; and the Iceman is having his very body blessed by a priest in an attempt to make it holy. The battle then begins, as the vampires attempt to press onto Utopia through land, air and sea. The ground and air forces stop, as Wolverine lands down and plows through his former comrades. Cyclops then presses the button on a remote that Doctor Nemesis gave him, which causes Wolverine to rear down in pain. It is revealed that before Wolverine went out on his hunt for Jubilee, he had his blood taken to see if his healing factor could counteract vampirism. But unknown to him, Nemesis has injected him with nanobots to shut down his healing factor, as Cyclops had anticipated that he might be bitten and turned before they could reactivate it. Back to his normal self, Wolverine turns on the vampires as the X-Men and Atlanteans push them out. Wolverine then warns Xarus over the video that he will be coming for him. Unfazed, Xarus orders that a second wave be sent in. However, his aide informs him that they sent in all their available forces and it may take time for a new strike force to be organized. But Xarus will have none of it, declaring that he will take Utopia today, raise a flag over it, stand over Wolverine's bones and drink Cyclops' blood. Just then, Dracula walks in, reasserting himself as Lord of the Vampires. He grants amnesty  to the other vampire sects for betraying him, all except Xarus. With the sudden return of his father Dracula, Xarus tries ordering his minions to help him, but receives no support. While the X-Men storm his lair, Xarus decides to deal with his father himself. But this time, Dracula is more careful and repays the favor by ripping off Xarus' head. It is then that the X-Men enter. Whereas Cyclops wants nothing more to do with the Vampire Nation, Blade does not see eye-to-eye with him and charges at Dracula, only to knocked unconscious with an optic blast. Cyclops then reminds Dracula of their previous, unspoken agreement. However, the Lord of the Vampires muses that if his son was successful in uniting the vampire sects into one functional alliance, then perhaps he may finish what he started: conquer Utopia. Cyclops reminds him that before they reunited his head with his body, X-Club was studying it, meaning that he has a trick up his sleeve. After a brief staredown, Dracula calls Cyclops' bluff, but nonetheless, decides to end hostilities with mutants. He even gives Jubilee back to them. Back at Utopia, Jubilee is put in isolation. Blade believes that the only solution is to put her out of her misery. Wolverine warns him not to, prompting the vampire hunter to leave. While watching on the monitor, Cyclops and Emma wonder if Jubilee can be cured.\n\nParagraph 16: Philipp Otto Runge (; 1777–1810) was a German artist, a draftsman, painter, and color theorist. Runge and Caspar David Friedrich are often regarded as the leading painters of the German Romantic movement. He is frequently compared with William Blake by art historians, although Runge's short ten-year career is not easy to equate to Blake's career.  By all accounts he had a brilliant mind and was well versed in the literature and philosophy of his time. He was a prolific letter writer and maintained correspondences and friendships with contemporaries such as Carl Ludwig Heinrich Berger, Caspar David Friedrich, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Henrik Steffens, and Ludwig Tieck. His paintings are often laden symbolism and allegories.  For eight years he planned and refined his seminal project, Tageszeiten (Times of Day), four monumental paintings 50 square meters each, which in turn were only part of a larger collaborative Gesamtkunstwerk that was to include poetry, music, and architecture, but remained unrealized at the time of his death.  With it he aspired to abandon the traditional iconography of Christianity in European art and find a new expression for spiritual values through symbolism in landscapes. One historian stated \"In Runge's painting we are clearly dealing with the attempt to present contemporary philosophy in art.\" He wrote an influential volume on color theory in 1808, Sphere of Colors, that was published the same year he died.\n\nParagraph 17: Bach composed the cantata in his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, shortly after he first performed his St John Passion, for the First Sunday after Easter, called . The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of John, \"our faith is the victory\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the appearance of Jesus to the Disciples, first without then with Thomas, in Jerusalem (). The unknown poet begins with a verse from the Second Epistle to Timothy, \"Remember that Jesus Christ … was raised from the dead\" (). The poet sees Thomas as similar to the doubtful Christian in general, whose heart is not at peace. The center of the cantata is the Easter hymn \"\" (The glorious day has appeared) by Nikolaus Herman (1560), praising the day of the resurrection. In contrast, movement 5 recalls the danger by the enemies, until in movement 6 Jesus appears, as he did to his disciples in Jerusalem, finally bringing peace. The line \"\" (Peace be with you) is repeated four times, framing three stanzas of a poem. The closing chorale is the first stanza of \"\" (Thou Prince of Peace, Lord Jesus Christ) by Jakob Ebert (1601).\n\nParagraph 18: Nearing the end of the rule of Carolingian dynasty over West Francia, Archbishop Adalbero and Queen Emma led a political party in favor of the Franks allying with the Ottonian dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire in the Frankish courts. In a series of letters sent to Empress Theophanu, Emma's sister-in-law, Adalbero expressed loyalty on behalf of himself, Queen Emma, and her son King Louis V (Adalbero's lord at the time). It was Emperor Otto I who had named Adalbero archbishop, along with the other clergy members who were given their positions by the emperor and is why Adalbero had felt such loyalty towards them. However, not all clergy felt the same way, and so they created a political party to oppose Queen Emma in the Frankish courts, one whose goal was to reinstate the policies of her husband, King Lothair, and expand the Frankish kingdom eastward, to gain the territory of Lorraine, Adalbero's home. The opposing party eventually prevailed when Louis disregarded the advice given to him by Adalbero and Emma, which was to seek friendship with Otto III, Theophanu's son. This unfortunate turn of events forced Adalbero to step down from his position as archbishop and flee. This act was perceived as treason by Louis, and Adalbero was called to trial at an assembly of leading Franks at Compiègne.  The sudden death of Louis V prevented this trial from taking place, and allowed Adalbero to give his support for Hugh Capet as rightful heir and denounce the Carolingian claimant, Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nParagraph 19: Rabbi Joseph Schwarz (1850) who had lived in Palestine for 16 years, identified the village of Abulnita, \"about 2 English miles east of Shechem\", as the site \"where Joseph lies buried\". Western travellers to Palestine in the 19th century described their impressions of the site in travelogues. John Ross Browne (1853) writes: \"We also visited the reputed site of Joseph's Tomb. A rude stone building covers the pretended sepulcher; but the best authorities deny that there was any evidence that Joseph was buried here.\" Howard Crosby also visited the site during 1851. He designated it, \"the so-called tomb of Joseph\", describing it as \"a plain white Santon's tomb, or Wely, such as is everywhere seen in Mohammedan countries, excepting that this one is roofless, and consequently lacks the usual white dome. In the interior, a vine grows from a corner, and spreads upon a trellis over the tomb, forming a pleasant bower.\" Louis Félicien Joseph Caignart de Saulcy and Edouard de Warren (1853) describe it as \"a small Mussulman oually (weli, i.e. chapel) ... said to be the tomb of Joseph\", noting it was just to the east of what the Arabs called Bir-Yakub, Jacob's Well. Hackett noted in 1857 that the tomb is placed diagonally to the walls, instead of parallel, and found \"the walls of the interior covered with the names of pilgrims, representing almost every land and language; though the Hebrew character was the most prominent one\". Thomson noted in 1883 that \"the entire building is fast crumbling to ruin, presenting a most melancholy spectacle\". Being exposed to the weather, \"it has no pall or votive offering of any kind, nor any marks of respect such as are seen at the sepulchres of the most insignificant Muslim saints.\" During the late 19th century, sources report the Jewish custom of burning small articles such as gold lace, shawls or handkerchiefs, in the two low pillars at either end of the tomb. This was done in \"memory of the patriarch who sleeps beneath\".\n\nParagraph 20: Dirty jokes were once considered subversive and underground, and rarely heard in public. Comedian Lenny Bruce was tried, convicted, and jailed for obscenity after a stand up performance that included off-color humor in New York City in 1964. Comedian and actor Redd Foxx was well known in nightclubs in the 1960s and 1970s for his raunchy stand-up act, but toned it down for the television shows Sanford and Son and The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour, stating in the first monologue of the latter show that the only similarity between the show and his nightclub act was that \"I'm smoking\". American society has become increasingly tolerant of off-color humor since that time. Such forms of humor have become widely distributed and more socially acceptable, in part due to the mainstream success in the 1970s and 1980s of comedians like Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's alter-egos Derek and Clive, Dolemite, and Andrew Dice Clay. George Carlin and Richard Pryor have used it as an effective tool for social commentary.\n\nParagraph 21: The final event in the series is an epic 25 mile open water canoe race held over two days. After arriving at the island the boys are not surprised to discover that they will be racing canoes. The first few days are fun for all with only light training, made easier by the fact that these canoes are proper oceangoing vessels with outriggers making them stable and straight. When the group help with harvesting the sea it becomes apparent that Joey and Jarvis are not comfortable at all, while Murray is in his element and the others, although not super confident, are showing good resilience and willpower. As the race approaches the length of the race is revealed to the athletes, as well as the course and its inherent dangers such as the reef, breaking waves, strong currents, sharks in the water and crocodiles near and on land. This leaves the athletes with very sober looks on their faces. The first day of paddling will see the boys reach one of two midpoint islands for the night, the catch being that if you attempt to make the second island and fail to do so before sunset you will be sent back to the first exhausted and with further to paddle on the second day. Ed believes that Murray may burn himself out as he did in Nepal and sets himself for a steady pace. Heavy rain the day before the race is a bad omen as it is always followed by strong winds and high seas. As the race begins, Murray's knowledge of the sea helps him through the reef and JJ is smart enough to stick close behind giving him second place. the other boys all struggle with the big waves hitting the reef and it's too much for Joey and Jarvis who retire almost immediately leaving the trainers shattered. Ed struggles for an hour but finally clears the reef while Wole requires help from a local. This sees an absolutely gargantuan performance from Wole who manages to pass all but Murray on the first leg with all the remaining athletes making it to the second island before sunset. While Murray is feeling good the others are exhausted and JJ in particular is struggling, having had his shoulder badly injured in the previous challenge. The next Wole is up first indicating his strong ambition to win, trying to get any advantage possible by consulting the locals. The first half of the second leg sees a fantastic struggle between Wole, Murray and Ed, with JJ dropping back in considerable pain and frustration. The run home on the second leg once again sees Wole simply out-muscling Murray and Ed who begin to fatigue. Murray stays in touch however and Wole once again struggles to overcome the reef, this time grounding his canoe badly. As Murray pushes to overtake Wole desperately scrambles over the reef, this time unassisted, cutting himself all over on the sharp reef. As Murray is approaching Wole manages to free himself and find a last effort for the shore where he arrives first, just in front of an exhausted Murray with Ed only a few minutes back finishing in third leaving JJ to struggle home in the rear. This huge effort sees Wole crowned the Last Man Standing overall.\n\nParagraph 22: For several more days, Davis led relatively quiet patrols, until November 30, Davis' 22nd combat mission in Korea. Around 16:00, Davis' flight of eight F-86s spotted a large group of nine Tupolev Tu-2 bombers from the Chinese 8th Bomber Division, escorted by 16 Lavochkin La-11 fighters from the Chinese 2nd Fighter Division near Sahol along the Yalu River. The force was en route to a bombing mission on Taehwado Island in the Pansong archipelago. Davis maneuvered the patrol into position for a firing pass on the bombers. He completed four attack runs on the formation, being continuously attacked by the La-11 fighters, which were unable to hit his aircraft. In spite of being separated from his wingmen, he managed to destroy two of the bombers and cause the crew of a third to bail out. By this time, another group of F-86s arrived to continue the fight, as Davis' aircraft were low on ammunition and fuel. As the flight attempted to withdraw, one of Davis' pilots, Raymond O. Barton, called for help. Davis flew to Barton's aid and found Barton's damaged aircraft under attack from 24 MiG-15s of the Chinese 3rd Fighter Division arriving as reinforcement. As two MiG-15s prepared a final attack on Barton, Davis swooped through their pass and scored direct hits on one, killing the Chinese flight leader who commanded the MiG pack. The second broke off its attack. Davis then escorted Barton's damaged aircraft back to base, landing with only  of fuel left in his tanks. For the day's actions, Davis was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Taehwado bombing mission forced the Chinese Air Force to end all bombing missions for the rest of the war, while the \"hat trick\"-plus-one of downing four Chinese aircraft in the fight resulted in raising Davis' confirmed victory count in Korea to six, making him the fifth jet ace of the war and the first man in the history of the US military to become an ace in two wars. At this point, Davis wrote to his family that he expected to be home by Christmas, but then the Air Force extended his tour of duty.\n\nParagraph 23: In December 2007, Ryan is followed repeatedly by a man in a blue car. He appears constantly and scares Ryan, who tells Michelle, but initially, the claims fall on deaf ears. The driver starts a conversation with him, using his name. Ryan, frightened, flees to the Rovers and tells Michelle and Liam. Liam tries to catch the mystery man but he escapes. He reappears several days later and goes to a house in the suburbs. Michelle, Liam and Ryan follow, determined to find out why this man is following Ryan. Michelle rings the doorbell and the door is answered by another 15-year-old, Alex Neeson (Dario Coates). She is horrified to see that Alex is the image of her late partner. Her worst fears are confirmed – Alex and Ryan were swapped accidentally just after birth, making Alex Michelle's biological son, not Ryan. Alex later appears in The Kabin and tells Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) that Michelle would pay for the sweets he wanted. Norris asks who his mother is and Alex tells him his mother is Michelle. Later that day, news spreads about Ryan not being Michelle's son and Ryan is not amused when Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel) comments on it. The police later arrive at The Rovers with Alex. He has been shoplifting and tells them Michelle is his mother. They ask her if this is true and Michelle tells them it is and that it is okay for him to stay at The Rovers. He stays for a couple of weeks, causing problems for everyone, so Ryan moves in with Liam and his wife Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie). He \"loses\" Steve's daughter Amy Barlow (Amber Chadwick) and barricades himself in the pub, but Michelle feels obliged to send him back to his adoptive mother, Wendy Neeson (Jane Slavin). She meets Alex again and has taken him to Ireland to meet his grandparents. She later tells Alex and his family that she cannot have Alex in her life because Ryan is her son.\n\nParagraph 24: During the 17th century, Sivaganga was ruled by the Kingdom of Ramnad, which had its boundary spreading across modern-day Sivaganga, Pudukkottai and Ramnathapuram. The seventh king of the empire, Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathi (also called Kelvan Sethupathy) ruled from 1674 to 1710 and was succeeded by his sister's son Vijaya Ragunatha Sethupathy. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Sundareswara Ragunatha Sethupathy in 1726. Bavani Sankara Thevan, the illegitimate son of Ragunatha Sethupathy, aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore to attack Ramnad. Though Bavani won, he did not honor the earlier decision to cede some portions of the empire to the King of Tanjore. He quarreled with Sasivarna Periya Oodaya Thevar and sent him out of his province. Both Sasivarna and Kattaya Thevar, the brother of Sundareswara, aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore. Both of them conquered Bavani in 1730 with the help of the army of Tanjore. Kattaya Thevar divided the kingdom into five provinces and gave two to Sasivarna, who became the first king of Sivaganga. As per legend, Sasivarna built the Teppakulam and fort around the spring \"Sivaganga\", where he met his spiritual guru Sathappan Servai. As per another account, Sasivarna was appointed as the king by the Nawab of Carnatic. Sasivarna died at around 1750 and his son Muthuvaduganatha Periya Udaya Thevar took over the reign. He was shot dead in 1780 by Nawab's troops. His widow Velu Nachiyar and infant Vellacci fled the region and were aided by the two Maruthu brothers namely Periya Maruthu and Chinna Maruthu. Velu Nachiyar ruled the region till 1790, when her daughter succeeded her. The brothers continued the support the new queen, and become de facto ruler of Sivaganga until 1801. The brothers rebelled against the British East India Company and Nawab of Carnatic, who was supporting the company. The brothers were later captured and hanged in Tirupathoor in 1801. The Company appointed Gowry Vallaba Periya Oodaya Thevar as the Zamindar of Sivaganga in 1801.\n\nParagraph 25: On January 1, 2006, KCEB, KLPN-LP and KTPN-LP lost the UPN affiliation to CBS affiliate KYTX (channel 19), which carried the network on its second digital subchannel. The station immediately switched its affiliation to The WB, effectively replacing \"KWTL\", a cable-only WB outlet that was part of The WB 100+ Station Group, a service that was created in September 1998 to expand The WB's national coverage primarily through cable-only outlets in smaller markets, which were managed locally by cable providers (since it was cable-exclusive, the channel used the \"KWTL\" callsign in a fictional manner). During the transition, KTPN and KLPN became independent stations.\n\nParagraph 26: On February 12, 2000, he defeated Jan Piet Bergman to win the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title. Bergman went down twice in the first round, but recovered in the second round, knocking Judah down. Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round to win the title. On June 20, 2000, Judah made his first title defense against Junior Witter in Glasgow, Scotland. It was an awkward fight for Judah, as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches. Witter frequently switched between fighting right-handed and left-handed, making him an elusive opponent. Judah's consistent body punching slowed Witter down, and in the fifth round, Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that hurt Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring. Judah defeated Witter by unanimous decision.\n\nParagraph 27: The flight of the Macrotus Is remarkable chiefly for its extreme maneuverability. The bat flies fairly rapidly on occasion, but the usual foraging flight is slow and buoyant, and more nearly silent that of most bats. In level flight Macrotus wings make a soft fluttering sound that is less sharp and carrying than the sounds made by the wing beats of most other bats. The method of landing is most interesting. The bat flies six to eight inches below the ceiling and upon the wings making a deep down stroke that is directed nearly straight forward the hind limbs and uropatagium. These movements cause the bat to swoop upward toward the ceiling and as the bat nears the ceiling the wings are pulled back in an upstroke while the bat rolls over 180 degrees so that its back is facing downward and the long legs reach for the ceiling. Stated briefly, then the alighting maneuver consists of an upward swoop and a half-roll, at the end of which the feet wing rapidly toward the ceiling, seize it, and the wings give a final beat to steady the bat. Often these landings must require remarkably precise judgement of speed and distance, as many landings are made in the midst of a fairly closely spaced group of bats. Macrotus has two main methods of launching into flight, by dropping form the ceiling and taking flight after a short downward swoop, and by taking flight directly form the roosting place. The bat often hovers, both when foraging and when flying in its daytime retreat. Macrotus seems to hover easily, and it’s able to hover for several seconds at a time. These bats usually forage within three feet of the ground and often drop down closer to the ground nearer the surface where they can occasionally hover for a few seconds. Even bats released in the daytime flew fairly close to the ground. Leaf-nosed bats seem to be totally insectivorous, and their food clearly reflects the bats’ foraging habits. Some insects regularly eaten by Macrotus are almost certainly taken from the ground or from vegetation. The bats’ stomachs often contain orthopteran insects, noctuid moths and caterpillars, and beetles of the families Scarabaeidae and Carabidae, along with unidentified material. The lists of food items of Macrotus contain a plethora of insects that seldom fly, are flightless, or that fly in the daytime; this constitutes strong evidence that this bat consumes insects that are on the ground or on vegetation. Most leaf-nosed bats forage sometime between one hour after sundown and four hours after sundown, and then retire to a night roosting place. Actually, each bat seems to have a pre-midnight foraging period of roughly one hour. The greatest activity in the early morning seems to occur between two and one half hours before sunrise and thirty minutes before sunrise. Bats generally begin returning with full stomachs to their daytime roosts about two hours before sunrise, and the last bats usually return approximately twenty minutes before sunrise.\n\nParagraph 28: In a Romani-Russian tale collected by Yefim Druts and Alexei Gessler and translated by author James Riordan as The Enchanted Hinny, a wealthy gypsy man trades in horses. His wife dies and leaves him their young son. The gypsy man remarries, but his new wife hates her step-son so much she complains to her mother. Years later, the man is ready to go to a horse fair and his son asks him to bring him the first thing his eyes greet when he enters the town. The man agrees and goes to the fair, setting his eyes on a pint-sized hinny. He buys the animal and brings it to his son. The boy treats and grooms the hinny. The stepmother's hatred of the boy comes to a head and she conspires with her mother to kill him: first, she bakes some rolls laced with poison; next, she gives him a shirt that will burn him to cinders. With the hinny's warnings, the boy avoids the dangers: he gives the rolls to dogs and throws the shirt in the oven. After failing twice, she and her mother discover the hinny is helping the boy, and she asks her husband to get rid of the little animal, since it bites her hand. The hinny advises the boy to ask for one last ride on the animal, then they will make their way to the distant mountains. It happens so, and they reach another kingdom. The hinny advises the boy to buy a sheep's skin and wears it on himself, and to utter the words \"know not how\". The boy follows the hinny's orders and finds work as a cook for a king, and answers his questions \"know not how\" - which becomes his new appellation: \"Know Not How\". One time, Know Not How goes to gather firewood, and chops down the tsar's sturdy oak by himself. Some time later, the elder princess is to be delivered to a six-headed sea dragon, but the king sends Know Not How and three knights to protect her and defeat the beast. Know Not How kills the monster and is given a ring by the princess, but he insists the three knights are to be celebrated as the true heroes. The second princess is also given to a nine-headed sea dragon; Know Not How kills the dragon and is given the princess's necklace. Lastly, the youngest princess is given to a twelve-headed sea monster, but the three knights drug Know Not How with a sleeping potion, and he falls asleep. The monster comes and the princess sheds a tear that wakes Know Not How. The gypsy boy fights the multiheaded monster to a standstill, but his hinny comes all of a sudden and helps him vanquish the beast. He gathers the monster's heads and buries them in the sand along with those from the previous monsters, then sends the three knights and the princess back to the palace to celebrate. During the feast, however, the youngest princess asks her father to invite the gypsy cook. Despite his reservations, the king allows for the cook to come. At a certain point, the three knights boast about their \"victory\", when the youngest princess asks them to show the guests the monsters' decapitated heads. This leads to Know Not How revealing the truth, him marrying the youngest princess, and the three knights being banished.\n\nParagraph 29: Megapaloelodus was named by American Alden H. Miller in 1944 on the basis of a fossil femur and tarsometatarsus collected from the lower Miocene Rosebud Formation of South Dakota. Recognizing similarities to fossils of Palaelodus, Miller described the material as a new genus of phoenicopteriform he named Megapaloelodus. Initially, Miller was under the impression that Megapaloelodus was a missing link between the basal Palaelodus and derived flamingos. In 1950 Loye H. Miller described the fragment of a tibiatarsus and an ulna from the late Miocene of California, also referring it to M. connectens. Miller notes that the California bones presents a sizable gap in both space and time while also not overlapping with any of the type material established six years prior. However, in the description he refers to the axiom \"Things that differ in the same way from the same thing do not differ from each other.\" Through this he reasoned that, as the Californian fossil differs from Palaelodus in similar ways as the fossils from South Dakota, they could have belonged to the same species. Although this conclusion was acknowledged as being tentative, Miller further explained that it seemed more reasonable than to establish a new species on such fragmentary remains. In addition to further finds from California, a second species was described from Juntura, Oregon by Pierce Brodkorb, M. opsigonus. This species may have also occurred further south in Mexico. In 1983 Jacques Cheneval published a major revision of the palaelodids of Saint-Gérand-le-Puy. Besides agreeing with prior studies that synonymized many of the European species, he also transferred Palaelodus goliath to the genus Megapaloelodus. Czech paleontologist Jiří Mlíkovský disagreed with this assessment in 2002 and instead suggested that Megapaloelodus should be synonymized with Palaelodus. However, this taxonomic treatment of the genus as a whole has been met with criticism and is considered premature by other authors. In 2009 several specimens from Argentina previously only identified as an indetermined phoenicopterid were described as the species Megapaloelodus peiranoi.\n\nParagraph 30: In 2011, Reis with Markus Brunnermeier, Luis Garicano, Philip R. Lane and others, argued that banks holding significant amounts of bonds issued by their sovereign creates a \"diabolic loop\", whereby small changes in the perceived solvency of the sovereign can amplify into large crises. This concept has become central in accounts of the Euro crisis and is also referred to as the \"doom loop\" or the \"bank-government nexus\". They proposed creating European Safe Bonds (ESBies), a new financial vehicle allowing banks in the Eurozone to break the diabolic loop without creating the problems of joint and several liability with Eurobonds. The European Systemic Risk Board proposed a variant of ESBies, labelled Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities (or SBBS) as a crucial ingredient to have a more stable Eurozone.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nIn this text, the author recounts a combat mission led by Davis during the Korean War. On November 30th, Davis and his squadron encountered a group of Chinese bombers and fighters en route to a bombing mission. Despite being attacked by the enemy fighters, Davis successfully destroyed two bombers and caused the crew of a third to eject. When another group of F-86s arrived, Davis's aircraft were low on ammunition and fuel. He flew to the aid of a fellow pilot who was under attack from 24 MiG-15s. Davis managed to shoot down one of the MiGs and escorted the damaged aircraft back to base. For his actions, Davis was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Additionally, the successful bombing mission on Taehwado Island led to the end of all Chinese bombing missions for the rest of the war. Davis's accomplishments in this mission raised his confirmed victory count in Korea to six, making him the fifth jet ace of the war and the first person in US military history to become an ace in two wars.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: Theseus' status in the cultic calendar of Athens, as represented by festivals such as the Pyanepsion, is unique given the fact that Theseus is inherently an outsider to the Athenians, being born in Megara. Theseus, despite his status as a foreign entity in an intensely nationalistic city-state (he would later be named an honorary citizen in the 5th century BCE), became representative of many essential Athenian traits. In fact, it has even been proposed that his actions in and his journey to Crete came to represent the naval power of the Athenians after the Persian Wars. This reveals the dynamic nature of Athenian festivals, as new understandings and depictions of founding myths may in turn lead to new understandings of the festival. The Pyanopsia and other Theseus-based Greek festivals may not have only symbolically thanked Apollo for the his actions and agricultural abundance, but also represented the values of their founders. The Pyanopsia also involved the worship of the Horae - the daughters of Themis, the goddess of divine law and order. By being worshipped at the Pyanopsia and a spring festival called the Thargelia, the Horai – Eunomia (well ordering) and Dike (right and justice) – are revealed as being connected to agriculture and vegetation.\n\nParagraph 2: Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"First offering from rapper's major-label debut, Mack Daddy, cheekily rhapsodizes about the joys of women with prominent backsides. Cute rhymes and slammin' beats add up to a potential smash at several formats.\" J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, \"In some cases, what's said can be as simple as Sir Mix-a-Lot's assertion 'I like big butts!' in the single 'Baby Got Back'. On the surface, it may seem that all he's doing is expressing an opinion, but there's more to it than Mix-a-Lot's personal preferences. At root, 'Baby Got Back' challenges the dominant standard for physical beauty in our culture, a standard that stresses long legs, slim hips, small buttocks and has no room for women with wide hips or protuberant posteriors. And the fact that 'Baby Got Back' spent five weeks at No. 1 suggests that there are millions who agree with his assessment.\" James Bernard from Entertainment Weekly remarked that the song \"alternates deftly between a critique of the Cosmo/Playboy narrow-minded — and narrow-hipped — standard of female beauty and a bawdy appreciation of, er, generous rear ends.\" In Melody Maker'''s review of the album, \"Baby Got Back\" was named \"worst of all\" and \"a hip hop \"Fatty Bum Bum\" and - Warning! Warning! - could be a novelty hit.\" Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone said the song \"celebrates a section of the anatomy long revered by rappers (\"beggin' for a piece of that bubble\" is a new twist).\"\n\nParagraph 3: Sortes Sanctorum (incipit Post solem surgunt stellae) is a late antique text that was used for divination by means of dice. The oldest version of the text may have been pagan, but the earliest surviving example—a 4th- or 5th-century Greek fragment on papyrus—is Christian. The original version had 216 answers available depending on three ordered throws of a single die. It was later revised down to 56 answers for a single throw of three dice. This version was translated into Latin by the time of the council of Vannes (465), which condemned its use. The Latin version was subsequently revised to render it more acceptable to ecclesiastical authorities. This Latin version survives in numerous manuscripts from the early 9th century through the 16th, as well as in Old Occitan and Old French translations. Beginning in the 13th century, the text was sometimes known as the Sortes Apostolorum, a title it shares with at least two other texts.\n\nParagraph 4: The convoy left Moscow on 12 August, despite any evidence of a concrete agreement as to where the convoy would go or what it would carry. It consisted of 280 army lorries, painted white, and was said to carry  of goods, \"including grain, sugar, medicine, sleeping bags and power generators\". A spokesman for the ICRC said that the Russian government had not provided \"basic details\" about the contents or route of the lorries. There were suggestions that the convoy was a trojan horse (or \"Trojan centipede\") operation, to \"smuggle weapons to rebel militias rapidly running low on fuel and ammunition\" Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, said that there were \"three conditions\" that had to be met by the Russian convoy: it should cross the border at a post controlled by the State Border Guard, it should be accompanied by ICRC workers, and it should clearly state its destination, its route, and what it carried. The Russian government said that its destination was Shebekino-Pletenivka border crossing, in Kharkiv Oblast. The convoy stopped in central Russia, about  from that border crossing, as Ukrainian Internal Affairs minister Arsen Avakov said \"no humanitarian convoy of Putin's will be allowed to cross the territory\". After some time, the convoy continued to Rostov Oblast. It headed toward insurgent-controlled Izvaryne border crossing, rather than the government-controlled Shebekino-Pletenivka in Kharkiv Oblast that had been agreed. It stopped in a field at Kamensk-Shakhtinsky,  from Izvaryne. Inspectors from the State Border Guard of Ukraine were sent to the field on 15 August to examine the contents of the convoy. The convoy drove to the insurgent-held Izvaryne border crossing on 17 August, after having been declared \"legal\" by the Ukrainian government. Despite this, the State Border Guard said that they had received no paperwork from the convoy, and the Red Cross had not yet given the convoy clearance to cross into Ukraine, citing \"security issues\". In a press briefing on 19 August, a spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said that an advance team of Red Cross workers was sent to the Izvaryne border crossing to assess the convoy, and to organise transport of its cargo to Luhansk. He also said that work on processing the convoy had been delayed because the DPR and LPR had not guaranteed the safety of the Red Cross workers that are meant to drive the convoy to its destination. The Red Cross gave the convoy instructions on how to deliver the goods to Luhansk on 21 August. The instructions dictated that the lorries should drive directly to the delivery point, and must be escorted by the ICRC at all times. Despite these instructions, the convoy entered Ukraine without customs clearance or an ICRC escort on 22 August. SBU chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said that this was tantamount to a \"direct invasion\", and the Red Cross said that it was not part of the moving convoy \"in any way\". The convoy was escorted into Ukraine by pro-Russian forces affiliated with New Russia. After delivering its cargo somewhere in Luhansk Oblast, the convoy crossed back into Russia at Izvaryne on 23 August.\n\nParagraph 5: Meanwhile, Raj and Priya come to Goa, where they run into a drunkard loitering near the mansion. The drunkard runs away on seeing them. On seeing the state of the house, they realise that Sonia has been robbed, but are later horrified to see Sonia dead. The duo run, but find that the child is left inside the mansion. Raj enters the mansion again to take him. He sees two eyes and legs of the killer behind a cupboard. Terrified, he gets out of the mansion with the child. Raj and Priya then inform Goa police about the murder. They keep the child inside a police van and run away. But Priya finds that she has left her suitcase inside the mansion inside which her passport is kept. Meanwhile, audience watch that Sonia's body is kept inside Priya's suitcase by somebody and kept outside the mansion. KK reaches the mansion and finds the suitcase. Thinking that it is containing lot of money, he takes it and reaches his room in hotel where Ruby is waiting for him. Meanwhile, Raj and Priya go back to the mansion to take her suitcase. Raj enters the mansion, but is arrested by Inspector Karan, the investigating officer and Ravi. Raj refuses to name Priya and it warms her heart as she watches on. Meanwhile, KK and Ruby find out that the suitcase contains a dead body, not money. They decide to dispose of the suitcase. Meanwhile, Priya takes Vicky to a church to drop him off but is seen by Rocky with the kid. As it was on the news to inform cops about a young girl with a kid, Rocky calls the police. Priya, who had wanted to help Raj, instead gets arrested and sent to jail. Priya and Raj become the prime suspects of the murder. Inside the jail, both fall for each other.\n\nParagraph 6: Morton claimed that he could define the intellectual ability of a race by the skull capacity. A large volume meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. He was reputed to hold the largest collection of skulls, on which he based his research. He claimed that each race had a separate origin, and that a descending order of intelligence could be discerned that placed Caucasians at the pinnacle and Negroes at the lowest point, with various other race groups in between. His research of ancient Egyptians was meant to show that this racial hierarchy had always existed and should remain in place. When confronted with evidence that many ancient Egyptians had dark skin like other Africans, Morton used skull measurements to corroborate the words of Georges Curvier: \"whatever may have been the hue of their skin, they belonged to the same race with ourselves.\" Aside from this occasionally dark-skinned Caucasian ruling class, Morton's skull measurements led him to admit \"Negroes were numerous in Egypt but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is, that of servants and slaves.\" Morton's scholarship greatly contributed to Egyptology and several other disciplines adopting the Hamitic Hypothesis, the idea that civilization is antithetical to Negroes and a legacy of the Caucasian race such that any evidence of civilization in Africa must have derived from Caucasian presence or influence. Morton's skull collection was held at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia until 1966, when it was transferred to the Penn Museum, where it is presently curated.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1720, the Dutch East India Company built a fort and factory called Lijdzaamheid (Lydsaamheid) on the spot of Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), since April 1721 governed by an Opperhoofd (chief factor), under authority of the Dutch Cape Colony, interrupted by Taylor's pirate occupation from April 1722 to 28 August 1722; in December 1730 the settlement was abandoned. Thereafter the Portuguese had—intermittently—trading stations in the Espírito Santo estuary. These stations were protected by small forts, usually incapable, however, of withstanding attacks by the natives. In 1779 the Austrian ship \"Joseph und Theresia\" of the Austrian East India Company lands at the bay and the Austrians erect the St. Joseph and St. Maria forts. In 1778, an Austrian expedition led by English adventurer William Bolts established a trading factory at Delagoa Bay. The factory, composed of 155 men and a number of women, traded in ivory, reaching as high as 75,000 pounds per year until the factory was expelled by the Portuguese in 1781.\n\nParagraph 8: The robust nasal bones, preserved in a single specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had a good sense of smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P. germainepetterae, but not P. madagascariensis. P. madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P. germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P. madagascariensis, but in P. germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.\n\nParagraph 9: The film begins with a protest under the strong leadership of trade unionist Anand Babu to enhance the lives of struggling labourers. Anand Babu leads a happy family life with his wife, Shantamma, and two sons, Vijay & Ravi. The factory management tries to bribe him but he does not yield then they show life threat to his family, so, he surrenders to them. Furious, labourers attack him, everyone looks at him as a traitor, so, he leaves the home and roams around aimlessly. Shantamma leaves the town along with children and starts working as a labourer. Vijay also assists her mother to educate his younger brother but Vijay becomes an atheist who never enters into the temple only accompanies his mother & brother and sits at its steps. Years roll by, Vijay works in the harbour as Coolie No. 786 where a worker Rahim advises him not to lose that badge as it is a lucky charm to him. Ravi becomes a graduate, moves to police training and loves the Police Commissioner's daughter Geetha. Parallelly, at the harbour, Vijay revolts against the atrocities made by a gangster Bhujangam. Discerning Vijay, Rambabu, another gangster appoints him as a white knight. Vijay courageously succeeds several tasks and every time his badge 786 shields him. Time passes, Vijay becomes a deadly gangster, gets acquaintance with a club dancer Anitha and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Ravi returns as a police officer, learns the reality and requests his brother to surrender but he refuses, so, Ravi leaves the house along with his mother. After that, an unknown person is found dead in a railway compartment, Ravi recognises him as his father Anand Babu after his funeral, Shantamma becomes sick and hospitalised. By the time, Ravi takes to warrant against Vijay and surrounds the hospital. As there is no other alternative, Vijay visits the temple and prays the god, the next day, when Shantamma recovers feels happy to know that her son has entered the temple for her. Thereafter, Vijay finds Anita is pregnant so, he decides to abandon from the underworld to marry her and also make confess for the forgiveness of his mother. Vijay informs his mother that he is coming to the temple as a reformed person but unfortunately, Anita is slaughtered by Bhujangam. In that rage, Vijay bursts out and kills Bhujangam. At last, in the final clash, Ravi pleads Vijay to surrender but he keeps trust in his badge and starts running. But his attempt fails as the badge slips and he is wounded to Ravi's bullet. Finally, Vijay reaches the temple and dies in his mother's lap and ultimately, Ravi is felicitated for pursuing justice.\n\nParagraph 10: A digital ion trap (DIT) is an ion trap having a trapping waveform generated by the rapid switching between discrete high-voltage levels. The timing of the high voltage switch is controlled precisely with digital electronic circuitry. Ion motion in a quadrupole ion trap driven by a rectangular wave signal was theoretically studied in 1970s by Sheretov, E.P. and Richards, J.A. Sheretov also implemented the pulsed waveform drive for the quadrupole ion trap working in mass-selective instability mode, although no resonance excitation/ejection was used. The idea was substantially revisited by Ding L. and Kumashiro S. in 1999, where the ion stability in the rectangular wave quadrupole field was mapped in the Mathieu space a-q coordinate system, with the parameters a and q having the same definition as the Mathieu parameters normally used in dealing with sinusoidal RF driven quadrupole field. The secular frequency dependence on the a, q parameters was also derived thus the foundation was laid for many modern ion trap operation modes based on the resonance excitation. Also, in 1999, Peter T.A. Reilly began trapping and subsequently ablating and mass analyzing the product ions from nanoparticles obtained from car exhaust with a primitive hybrid square wave/sine wave driven 3D ion trap. In 2001 Reilly attended the 49th American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Applied Topics where he presented his nanoparticle mass analysis work and met Li Ding for the first time. Reilly suggested to Ding at that time that they should focus the DIT for analysis in the high mass range where other instruments could not compete. However, work published by Ding and Shimadzu over the years following the 2001 meeting were focused on development of square wave driven DIT's in the conventional mass range of commercial instrumentation. During this time Reilly began developing digital waveforms to increase the mass range of quadrupole-based mass spectrometers and ion traps that operate with rectangular waveforms. Over the course of eighteen years, the Reilly group contributed substantially to the development of modern digital waveform technology (DWT), its implementation and characterization, methods of waveform generation, and general theory which includes but is not limited to stability diagrams, the pseudopotential model, and more recently digital quadrupole acceptance. In parallel to Reilly's achievements but also working separately, the Ding group at the Shimadzu Research Lab continued to implement their digital drive technology for a 3D ion trap. Finally, after 18 years Shimadzu unveiled a bench top MALDI square wave driven 3D ion trap mass spectrometer that was designed to work in the higher mass range at the 2019 ASMS conference. The DIT technology has also been developed and implemented in the linear and 3D quadrupole ion traps by many other groups around the world.\n\nParagraph 11: MIBR started off group B by thrashing its compatriots in Sharks Esports as Leonardo \"leo_drunky\" Oliveira went the whole map without getting a kill; although he did get two kills, he killed one of his teammates and killed himself to set his kill total back to zero. NRG and North had an extremely close game, but NRG managed to come out in the end after winning four of the last five rounds. Ghost could not keep up its superb EPL season against mousesports as the majority-Canadian team could not get much done on either side of the map. Natus Vincere (Na'Vi) and ORDER played in a sloppy game, but Na'Vi came back from a 10–5 deficit and then again at 14–13 to barely scrape past the Australians to move on in the winner's bracket. Sharks pulled off a massive upset over North, and the win was not a close one as Sharks completely dominated the Danes. In the other lower bracket game, Ghost easily took down ORDER in the first map, but was forced to come back from an 8–13 deficit in the second map as Ghost eliminated the Australians. MIBR and NRG dominated each other's picks, but MIBR came back from a 5–10 deficit and then a 12-15 disadvantage to go on and win in overtime to secure a playoffs spot. Na'Vi was able to win its initial match when, in the past, the win eluded them, but the CIS team was smashed by mousesports as mousesports cruised its way to a playoff berth. Na'Vi easily defeated Sharks in two maps to send South America's representative home. Ghost and NRG had a very close series. NRG barely defeated Ghost in the first map and Ghost had only a slightly easier time in the second map. In the third map, NRG had a comfortable 11-4 halftime lead, but its performance against MIBR nearly replicated itself as Ghost came all the way back to win the game 16–14, thanks in part to Yassine \"Subroza\" Taoufik's 26 kills. In the final winner's match, MIBR barely defeated mousesports, but then easily took the second map to win the group. In the lower bracket side, Ghost surprisingly took the first map against Na'Vi. In the second map, Na'Vi had a 15–11 lead, but Ghost came back to tie the game; however, Na'Vi was able to win the game in overtime. Na'Vi carried that momentum and took advantage of Ghost's inexperience to easily take the third map and take the final playoff spot.\n\nParagraph 12: Upon experiencing an emotional breakdown, Jackson began facing a long-term case of depression. She in turn developed her new record as a concept album, using introspection as its theme. Its title is a metaphor for emotional boundaries, as well as an allusion to an individual's need to feel special. Its lyrics address subject matter such as depression, self-worth, social networking, and domestic violence. It also encompasses themes of sexuality, including BDSM, sexual orientation and same-sex relationships. Due to its sexually explicit content, the album reinforced Jackson's public image as a sex symbol and as one of the most erotic vocalists of the 1990s. Its incorporation of social issues regarding sexual orientation and combating homophobia also established her reputation as a gay icon and received the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music.\n\nParagraph 13: The supervillain Helmut Zemo took the Citizen V name for his imposture as a superhero when various superheroes were thought to be killed. Claiming to be John Watkins' grandson, Helmut took the name as an ironic taunt, due to the fact that his father had murdered the original war hero. Helmut assembled a group of villains and changed their costumes and codenames to pretend to be a new superhero team. Helmut's leadership and fighting abilities allowed him to successfully pose as Citizen V. Eventually, Helmut revealed himself as a villain and was defeated by the Avengers, the Fantastic Four and the Thunderbolts that turned against him. This marked the end of Helmut's Citizen V tenure and he went back to using the Baron Zemo title. Helmut would eventually come into conflict with a subsequent Citizen V (Dallas Riordan). Eventually, Zemo had the opportunity to play Citizen V for a second time: Helmut gets beheaded after a battle with Scourge (a.k.a. Nomad), and his mind was ironically arranged to end up in the comatose body of John Watkins III. Helmut took back the Citizen V identity, and due to a deal worked out between the V-Battalion and the CSA he began recruiting members for the Redeemers. As Citizen V, he soon discovered that Baron Strucker was the mastermind that manipulated Henry Peter Gyrich into sending Scourge; Helmut got his revenge by chopping off Strucker's hand. Helmut returned to the Redeemers, but they were soon wiped out by Graviton. Helmut escaped the battle, but perhaps due to Watkins's influence, he came back to fight Graviton with the re-assembled Thunderbolts. The battle ended with the Thunderbolts being sent to Counter-Earth. The V-Battalion had tried to teleport Citizen V away and were successful but due to a fluke, Helmut's mind was not transported with Watkins's body and Helmut found himself trapped in the Fixer's tech-pack (later, he had the Fixer place his mind into his Counter-Earth counterpart's body).\n\nParagraph 14: The most distinctive characteristic of Masiakasaurus is the forward-projecting, or procumbent, front teeth. The teeth are heterodont, meaning that they have different shapes along the jaw. The first four dentary teeth of the lower jaw project forward, with the first tooth angled only 10° above the horizontal. These teeth are long and spoon-shaped with hooked edges. They have carinae, or sharp edges, that are weakly serrated. Serrations are more evident along the rear edge the posterior teeth in the back of the jaw, which are also recurved and laterally compressed (flattened from the side), resembling the less unusual teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs. The margin of the dentary curves downward so that the alveoli (tooth sockets) of the front teeth are directed forward. In fact, the alveolus of the first tooth is actually situated lower than the bottom edge of the rest of the lower jaw. The lower part of the rear edge of the dentary has a long prong, known as a ventral process. This differs from the situation in abelisaurids, which have a much shorter ventral process. On the other hand, the upper part of the rear edge of the dentary is very similar to that of abelisaurids such as Majungasaurus and Carnotaurus. This part of the bone possesses an array of four small structures, three of which line a socket which connects to the surangular bone at the back of the lower jaw. Although the surangular bone is not preserved, several other bones of the lower jaw are, including a triangular angular bone, a gently curving prearticular bone, and a damaged yet notably concave articular bone. The angular and prearticular formed the lower edge of a large and rounded in the lower jaw (known as a mandibular fenestra) while the articular bone formed the lower part of the jaw joint. A long and tapering hyoid (tongue bone) has also been preserved.\n\nParagraph 15: The song received very positive reviews. Aspects lauded were the vocal delivery, rhyme pattern, production and political material covered. Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters was positive: \"In 'The Way I Am', Eminem expounds, 'Since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse / And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works / And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve / All this tension, dispensin' these sentences.' So there it is: he's performing therapy.\" AllMusic highlighted the song. Sputnikmusic described this song as \"Amityville's portrayal of the Detroit he grew up in; 'The Way I Am' as a whole\". Same critic listed it in Recommended Downloads and praising the single: \"Built over doomy, gothic arpeggios, rumbling bass, and church bells, Eminem lays down one of the most perfectly formed lyrics of his career, weaving in and out of a tight rhyme scheme that echoes the loping piano motif. Interesting aside: this is one of the first Eminem songs that gives him 100% of the writing credits.\" IGN praised the song: \"Eminem is an angry ass white boy and the vitriol continues on 'The Way I Am', in which he soundly states 'I am whatever you say I am / If I wasn't why would I say I am?' And when he complains that he's 'so sick and tired of being admired...', one almost believes that he'll hang up the mic and disappear (but Em obviously loves the attention so that's not an option at this point in the game). The throbbing, tubular bell and piano laced beat only add to the intensity of the track (incidentally it was crafted by Em himself and it's one of the more stellar examples of his often hit or miss production techniques).\" Sal Cinquemani called this song: \"He (Eminem) revels in the fact that there's teen violence in upper-class cities on the epic 'The Way I Am'. The song was named the 35th Best Song of the decade by the magazine Complex. The same magazine, in April 2011, ranked the song at #3 on their 100 Best Eminem Songs list. The line, \"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am\" was taken from the song \"As The Rhyme Goes On\" by Eric B. & Rakim from the album Paid in Full .\n\nParagraph 16: The music video opens with Ed Sheeran who is first seen sitting down in a lonely dark room save for the sunlight that shines beside him with footages featuring his love interest and fellow boxer (Jennie Pegouskie) and his upcoming match. As the song begins, we see Sheeran shadowboxing while Pegouskie is already at the gym ready for the workout. She hangs herself at the punching bag doing sit-up and stretches herself. A little while later, Pegouskie shadowboxes and punches a punching bag when Sheeran lately arrives at the training carrying a bag with him. After Sheeran places his bag at the closet, he proceeds to train himself for his upcoming match trained by a personal trainer along with Pegouskie who still warms up herself. Later, Sheeran and Pegouskie head out of the gym towards a restaurant while bonding each other. Upon arriving, the couple eat and shared foods like canoodling over a fried chicken as they have an intimate conversation with each other, although their dialogue is entirely mute. Afterwards, Sheeran and his girlfriend ride a taxi and make out at the back seat while the taxi driver does not notice this as he is focusing on driving. Back at the gym, Sheeran and Pegouskie physically trained hard doing various training exercises. While training, the couple embraced each other and teach one other, eventually falling in love with each other in the process. Later, Pegouskie leaves a picture and a box to Sheeran in a closet and seemingly abandons him. The scene cuts back to Sheeran who discovers a picture and a black box both seen earlier with the latter containing a blue mouthguard featuring a \"÷\" symbol at the front. Realizing that his girlfriend had left him (unbeknownst to him, she already is at a passenger ship), He starts to search for her to no avail. In response to her disappointing departure, Sheeran lets out his frustration and proceeds to an intense workout that includes tire-flipping, shadowboxing, sit-up, running and push-up. Later, Sheeran participates a match he has anticipated throughout the clip but he unexpectedly encounters a Rikishi or a sumo wrestler (Yamamotoyama Ryūta), much to his shock. During the match, Sheeran is seen almost always avoiding Yama who constantly chases him and the latter fails to defeat the Rikishi. Sheeran ends up getting defeated and is thrown at the edge of the ring crying in agony with the crowd encouraging him to stand up. Towards the end of the video, Yama wins the match but Pegouskie emerges the scene among the crowd flying into the ring with a karate kick in the air aiming towards Yama as the scene cuts to black with the text that reads “DIRECTED BY: JASON KOENIG”. Sheeran is last seen at the end of the music video struggling to get up while lying down on the floor but he fails to do so.\n\nParagraph 17: With increased cyber threats and attacks, legislation has evolved to incorporate how to establish responsibility in the event of a breach. Key terms in privacy bills and laws cite 'reasonable security' or 'duty of care' as a requirement of organizations when managing sensitive data. If a company manages private information such as social security numbers (SSN) or personal health information (PHI), it is their responsibility to practice 'duty of care' and establish 'reasonable controls' to protect this data. For example, if a hacker group attacks a bank with ransomware, and they exfiltrate all their client data - who is responsible for potential wire fraud, identity theft, and costs for litigation? Businesses are required to demonstrate they have implemented a security strategy based on their risk profile, as it is specific for each working environment. Legislation is outlining specific roles for executives in order to carry out 'duty of care' properly, as in the case of the Colorado Privacy Act. It states, \"A controller shall take reasonable measures to secure personal data during both storage and use from unauthorized acquisition. The data security practices must be appropriate to the volume, scope, and nature of the personal data processed and the nature of the business.\" The New York Privacy Act (NYPA) also proposed a 'duty of care' for risk assessments by controllers regarding personal data.\n\nParagraph 18: In Mick's absence, Linda hires a new bar manager, Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) and agrees with Shirley to sell The Queen Vic's freehold in order to solve their financial problems. Mick returns and walks in on Whitney and Woody in bed after having sex. He then punches Woody and throws him out. He later learns that Shirley and Linda sold the freehold of The Queen Vic behind his back and forged his signature, and turns to alcohol to deal with the stress. He also learns that Max Branning (Jake Wood) set up the deal, and confronts him, branding him a snake and warning him to stay away from him. He then kisses a vulnerable Whitney who responds. Shirley learns of the kiss and tells Whitney to pack her bags and leave. When Mick learns that Shirley did this, he drunkenly throws a glass at her, but instantly regrets it and cries, saying he no longer knows himself. Mick tells Linda about the kiss on her return but is then left devastated when she tells him their relationship is over. Later, Linda agrees to give Mick another chance but when her admits he made a failed attempt to pay Whitney off with £200, Linda slaps him. Following a reconciliation and a holiday, Mick discovers Linda had cancer and did not tell him, so he leaves her. However, they get back together the following day. The freeholders of the pub, Grafton Hill, demand £60,000 for structural repairs, saying they will be evicted if they do not pay. Business consultant Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner) tells them she has reduced it to £50,000, which they manage to raise. However, James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) claims to own the pub, and Fi, his daughter, denies reducing the debt; the family are given a month to leave the pub. They tell James they will take the company to court, but James reveals that he knows Mick's signature was forged on the paperwork, so the Carters start looking for a new home. Mick turns down a pub in Stratford-upon-Avon after meeting Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin), who is arranging a robbery and he manipulates Mick into joining his team, along with Phil, Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) and Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). Mick is shot in the arm by Callum \"Halfway\" Highway (Tony Clay) during the heist and is treated by Mariam Ahmed (Indira Joshi). Mick recovers, but the money they stole then goes missing. Halfway, who is an army friend of Lee's, moves into The Queen Vic, and the Carters are able to buy back the pub from Fi when Halfway gives them a ring he stole during the heist that is worth £200,000. This causes Aidan to suspect Mick of stealing the money, so he has a drug dealer start dealing from the Vic's toilets. When Mick tries to stop this, Aidan threatens to take The Queen Vic from them, as he has already taken The Albert bar from Vincent, and also threatens to hurt Johnny, who has moved away, and Nancy. Linda has the drug dealer arrested so Aidan threatens to have Mick killed. Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) gives Mick the number of a hitman, and when Mick discovers Aidan has covered The Queen Vic hallway as well as Ollie in petrol, the Carters agree to contact him to get rid of Aidan, but Linda stops it. The Carters then prepare to leave for Watford but Mick returns to The Queen Vic at the last minute to confront Aidan. He stands up to Aidan but Aidan beats him with his cane. He's stopped when Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Billy, Linda, Shirley and Ted barge in and stop him. Aidan calls on his henchman and he threatens to set the pub on fire unless Mick makes an apology. He's forced to say sorry and Aidan leaves but gets punched by Phil and is warned off by Phil's knowledge that Aidan murdered Luke Browning (Adam Astill), giving back the Carters control of The Queen Vic.\n\nParagraph 19: There are two USGS stream gauges on Noonday Creek, both operating since October 2000 and reporting via uplink to GOES weather satellites.  The first is at Hawkins Store Road, at the south end of Noonday Creek Park.  This is at ,  AMSL, and has a watershed area of .  This has location identifier NDYG1 and is reported to be  north-northwest of Blackwells.  The second is at Shallowford Road, just downstream (north) at the other end of the park, next to the entrance to the water treatment plant.  This is at ,  AMSL, with a watershed area of , including Little Noonday Creek. This is identified as NOOG1 and is reported as \"near Woodstock\".  Both streamflow and stage (depth) are reported at both locations, with a rain gauge also at the latter.  The National Weather Service does not issue river flood warnings or statements for this creek as it does for Sope Creek and others in the area, nor did it set an official flood stage for it until after the 2005 flood.  Minor flood stage is now considered to be , while major flood is , both at the Shallowford gauge.  The highest the original gauges could read was , replaced with  ones after the 2005 flood.\n\nParagraph 20: Harrison's acclaimed triple album All Things Must Pass (1970) was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in March 2001 and, as of 2011, was still the most successful album by an ex-Beatle. All Things Must Pass produced the international number 1 hit \"My Sweet Lord\", which was coupled as a double A-side with \"Isn't It a Pity\" in the majority of countries. In 1971 Harrison recorded pop music's first charity single, \"Bangla Desh\", and released the Concert for Bangladesh triple live album (credited to George Harrison & Friends) to raise further funds for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. His 1973 album Living in the Material World and the single \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" repeated the US success of his 1970 solo releases by simultaneously holding the number 1 position on Billboard'''s albums and singles charts. The remainder of his 1970s studio albums, starting with Dark Horse (1974), were all certified gold by the RIAA but performed disappointingly on the UK albums chart. Following the expiration of his EMI-affiliated Apple contract, Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976) was Harrison's debut release on his Dark Horse label, distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Records.\n\nParagraph 21: Revolutionary changes in the curriculum of pharmaceutical education were one of Dr. Prescott’s biggest accomplishments. Throughout the nineteenth century, a prerequisite for the higher level pharmaceutical study was based mostly on apprenticeship programs where pharmacists learned on a practical basis. According to professor Edward Parrish, member of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, the goal of the apprenticeship programs were to give students a pre-professional experience and prepare them for admission to courses offered by colleges. However, there were no legal requirements for preparatory training in high school prior to the enrollment in an apprenticeship program. So College of Pharmacy continued to enroll students that were experts on memorizing drug names and doing hands-on work but lacked in fundamental knowledge of basic science. Once Dr. Prescott gained responsibility of the School of Pharmacy in University of Michigan, he took quite an innovative step by launching a program that not only offered extensive laboratory experience in basic science but also eliminated the requirement for apprenticeship for the first time in history. Many including, the editor of American Journal of Pharmacy, William Procter were skeptical about the merit of the diploma offered at the University due to such non-traditional course requirements. Dr. Prescott was even denied to be a delegate to the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA) meeting in 1871. According to the clause of byLaws of APhA, “All colleges of Pharmacy or local Pharmaceutical Organizations shall be entitled to five representatives” but the University of Michigan did not fall under the definition of School of Pharmacy or Pharmaceutical Organization due to its different curriculum. Following the report of APhA, Dr.  Prescott presented his response saying that apprenticeship was not the best way to teach students since it ignored the nature of materials the students deal with. He further supported his argument by saying that “the pharmacist that trained the apprentice was also a recipient of a non-scientifically oriented apprenticeship” so there was no net advancement in actual pharmaceutical knowledge. Besides advocating for laboratory-based pharmaceutical education, he promoted preparatory courses prior to college enrollment. He made “three years' schooling in Latin and German, algebra through quadratic equations, botany, and elementary physics, besides arithmetic through involution and evolution, and the correct writing of English” a requirement for the University of Michigan prior to enrollment to ensure proper understanding for the higher level courses. Dr. Prescott’s innovative steps might not have been welcomed at first but eventually, educators and leaders in charge of pharmaceutical education realized the importance of his acts and adapted to the new changes.\n\nParagraph 22: Duck claimed to support \"restoring fiscal responsibility to Washington\" by eliminating \"the culture of corruption and fraud, (reexamining) current spending to match current priorities, and (rolling) back the tax cut for the top two percent of Americans\". His infrastructure platform called for ensuring that Maryland can \"support water, sewer, transportation and education\" while preserving \"open spaces... rural heritage (and) affordable housing\". On education, he supports increased funding and claims that the No Child Left Behind Act has been a failure due to underfunding and a lack of flexibility. He was an advocate of gun ownership restrictions and sought to reduce gun violence by closing the gun show loophole, providing universal health care, including mental health care, and promoting the registration of weapons and a law enforcement focus on violent criminals and anti-gang initiatives. He supported energy independence, believing it can be achieved in 10 years; his proposals included \"re-engineering federal buildings to reduce government energy consumption\", raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, increasing funding for mass transit, requiring disclosure of home energy costs and offering tax \"incentives for energy conservation and (the) use of mass transit.\" He opposed partially privatizing Social Security. He also advocated federal legislation to change bankruptcy protection so that individuals' retirement is \"safe and secure\". He supported universal health care and environmental protection, which he claimed was rolled back by the George W. Bush Administration. Specifically, on the environment, he supported the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; he believed that the Healthy Forests Initiative and the Clear Skies Act have a negative impact on the environment. Though his website does not cover the issue, Duck has been described as supporting civil unions as the first step towards marriages equality, and supports equal rights for the LGBTQ community.\n\nParagraph 23: He was not offered a professional contract at Chesterfield by manager Arthur Cox and so left the club without making a senior appearance at Saltergate. However, he was soon spotted playing amateur football in Nunthorpe by Hartlepool United manager Billy Horner. Houchen joined the \"Monkey Hangers\" on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one-year contract on £30 a week. When he arrived at the Victoria Park, Hartlepool were a struggling Fourth Division club. He made his debut in a 1–1 home draw with Crewe Alexandra. Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that \"we used to have a mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques. Only about six of them would go through and the rest would bounce.\" He scored his first senior goal against Barnsley on 24 March 1978. He scored further goals against Darlington, Rochdale and Newport County to end the 1977–78 campaign with four goals in 13 games. He played regular first team football in 1978–79, and scored 13 goals in 42 games to become the club's top scorer. He then went on to score 14 goals in 44 games in 1979–80, as the club finished 19th, just two points above the re-election zone. His goalscoring record attracted the attention of bigger clubs, however club chairman Vince Barker told Reading that even if Houchen was available then they would not be able to afford him. His exploits continued into the following season, and the club rejected bids of up to £80,000 from Plymouth Argyle and Cardiff City. He scored 17 goals in 48 appearances in 1980–81, yet again becoming the club's top scorer, as Hartlepool were in the promotion hunt until a late spell of bad form sent them down the table to ninth. He hit 19 goals in 38 games in 1981–82 to become the club's top-scorer for a fourth consecutive season. However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.\n\nParagraph 24: The season was not without confrontation, as O'Neal in one team meeting said, \"I have something to say. I think Kobe is playing too selfishly for us to win.\" O'Neal felt pressure to be leader of the team and was upset with Bryant's shot selection. Teammate Ron Harper helped mediate the differences between O'Neal and Bryant. According to Jackson, \"Kobe didn't have a selfish agenda; he just felt that the way he had been playing was the best way he could contribute. Gradually, he's seen there is a different way to contribute that incorporates more of the team.\" Upon arriving at the Lakers that season, Winter said he was stunned to discover the level of hatred O'Neal expressed toward Bryant. \"There was a lot of hatred in [O'Neal's] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going.\" O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant made it a point to get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him. During that season's All-Star Game, Bryant did not participate in the Slam Dunk Contest and a matchup against Vince Carter, following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's crossover dribble but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an inside joke between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the triangle offense to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.\n\nParagraph 25: Koehler attended Harvard College for his freshman and sophomore years, before entering the United States Naval Academy in 1905. In the summer between Harvard and Annapolis, Koehler gave a preview of his brazen ability to bluff that would serve him well in war-ravaged Germany and Russia fifteen years later. Hungry and broke, he and three friends drove to New York city from Cambridge, Massachusetts, after changing three tires along the way. Arriving in the city, Koehler suggested a trip to the theater. Marching up to the ticket window, he barked, \"I say, gimmi mi tickets.\" The ticket-man politely asked \"What name?\" and Koehler gave his last name. Knowing the ticket-man would not find any tickets under \"Koehler\" and that the ticket agencies were closed, Koehler fumed, \"call Tyson and see about it.\" Koehler's ploy worked, and the ticket agent offered them choice tickets that Koehler condescendingly took. Coming out of the theater later and still famished, the group headed up Fifth Avenue and bumped into one of Koehler's best friends who staked them for a meal. \"We paid for the tickets the next day, for we thought we might want to work the same game again.\" Koehler wrote in a letter shortly after arriving at Annapolis, \"Everybody in town, officers, professors, and 'cits', (fellow midshipmen) thinks it most extraordinary that I should go into the Academy ... they say that for a man who has tasted life at Harvard, it is a mighty hard thing to buckle down to the exact routine [and] discipline... in practice here [but] I am going to do my very best here, to make up for my past, and to do something for my future and for the future of the ones I love.\" What in the eighteen-year old Koehler's past he felt that he had to make up for is unclear. The stories of his arrival at Annapolis vary only in their \"outrageousness\": that he arrived with a horse and valet; another recounts a horse and cook. While at the academy, he maintained a pied-à-terre with a steward, where hot food was always available to all comers. He was known for his success as a ladies' man, often sending American Beauty roses to the objects of his affection. At Annapolis, Koehler qualified as a rifle expert shot in 1908, the highest level, and was awarded the Navy Sharpshooter's Badge. Somewhat presciently, the page entry for Koehler in the Naval Academy annual Lucky Bag contains two quotes from Shakespeare that were placed by the editors and intended to capture his essence, \"The glass of fashion and the mold of form, the observed of all observers\", and \"I am not in the roll of common men.\" The yearbook editors' words are equally descriptive, \"A capable, conceited man who cannot be bluffed.\" During the winter before Koehler graduated from Annapolis, his grandfather passed away. Before he died, Henry revealed the purported secret of Hugo's birth. He told Hugo that his father was not Oscar Koehler, but Rudolph, crown prince of Austria. There is no record of how Hugo responded to this shocking disclosure. But for the rest of his life, Koehler searched for some proof of this. He revealed the story to only his closest confidants, and speculated that the truth was locked in the archives of the Vatican, that could not be opened for 99-years, until 1987, long after his death.\n\nParagraph 26: P. anchises.

In 1190 a meeting was held at Clonfert to try and establish peace between the two claimants but was unsuccessful. Crobhdearg narrowly escaped drowning soon after when his ship was wrecked in a storm on Lough Ree, himself and six others being the only survivors, thirty-six others perishing. In 1195 he led a hosting into Munster destroying several castles and towns. By 1197 conflict had flared up between him and Rory O'Flaherty lord of west Connacht whereupon he was taken prisoner by Crobhdearg after having fled from him the previous year by sea to Thomond. In 1199 Crobhdearg made peace with Cathal Carragh granting him lands in Connacht, seemingly gaining recognition as undisputed king in return. In the same year he raided lands of the Normans in Connacht and the next year the foreigners of Meath with Rory O'Flaherty lord of west Connacht dying in his service on this expedition. Crobhdearg then turned on Cathal Carragh who managed to flee beforehand to the woods and defeat an army sent to pursue him by the king. Carragh then approached the Norman lord William de Burgh giving up his son to them as a guarantee of payment for their aid. They marched on Connacht with allies from Leinster, Thomond, Limerick and Dublin gaining the submission of many of the lords of Connacht forcing Crobhdearg to flee north first to Fermanagh, then the court of the O'Neill's gaining their backing for the kingship.\n\nParagraph 28: Dave Wilson Nursery is the largest wholesale grower of fruit trees for the home garden in the United States. It’s afamily-owned and operated nursery established in 1938, and now a corporation. It is one of the largest growers of deciduous fruit, nut and shade trees in the USA, farming more than  on a four-year rotation, growing more than two million trees a year. Its growing grounds are east of Modesto, California, near Hickman, California; and its regional office and variety test block are situated east of Reedley, California. The nursery, says its website, is the primary licensee and propagator (in the United States) of new fruit varieties developed by Zaiger's Genetics, including the Pluot and the Aprium.\n\nParagraph 29: The narrator is a young German landed in a French port. He misses the train to Germany, as the ship docks at a late hour. Thus, he has to spend a night in a city that is a stranger to him. Walking in the streets of the small city at night, he hears a woman singing Weber's Der Freischütz. Hearing his mother tongue in a French city attracts the young man and he follows the voice to find its source. Eventually, he finds what he is looking for: the voice is from a small bar-like brothel. When he attempts to get in, he suddenly sees a strange man peeking inside. As soon as the man sees him, he runs away. The narrator walks in and sits at one of the tables. It is midnight and he is the only guest at the bar. A fleshy, exhausted prostitute comes to him and orders alcohol with her German accent. The young man is uncomfortable with the bar's sultry atmosphere and the lackadaisical, tired prostitute – he decides to leave. But suddenly, the prostitute comes to life and bursts into laughter by looking at the door – the man who ran away is there again. The prostitute humiliates the man and tries to make him jealous by snuggling the narrator. The narrator feels sorry for the man and can't stand the prostitute's ruthlessness and therefore decides to leave. Walking in the labyrinthine alleys in the moonlight and trying to find his hotel, he suddenly hears a man offering help – it is the man at the bar. While walking together to the narrator's hotel, the strange man begins speaking swiftly. He says that the prostitute is his wife and due to his selfishness, she has left him and that he spent all of his wealth by running after her. The man asks the narrator to talk to his wife to make her return to him. The narrator is stumped and does not respond to any of his requests. The strange man continues talking and says that he can not stand seeing her with other men and that he will not leave her there alive – he talks about the knife he bought that day. The next day, the narrator tries to find the bar but the alleys look quite unfamiliar to him in the daylight. But when he goes by moonlight from his hotel to the night train, he suddenly notices the alley where the bar in. The man is, again, in front of the bar. When the man sees the narrator, he beckons to him. This makes the narrator worry and since he is about to miss the night train, he leaves the bar and the alley mercurially. At the last moment, the narrator hesitates as the man, with something silvery in his hands, determinedly enters the bar.\n\nParagraph 30: XII Corps was not among the assault formations on D Day (6 June 1944) and its subordinate formations and units were fed into the Normandy beachhead over the weeks following the landings. In fact, 86th A/T Rgt fought its first action under the orders of VIII Corps before XII Corps HQ had landed. This was in support of 43rd Wessex Division, 46th Highland Brigade (of 15th (Scottish) Division) and 31st Tank Brigade in an attack to capture Éterville, Maltot and Hill 112 (Operation Jupiter). The attack was launched early on 10 July behind a massive artillery barrage. The defending German Panzergrenadiers and Panzer IV tanks of 1st and 10th SS Panzer Divisions were supported by Tiger I tanks of 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Although themselves heavily armoured, the Churchill tanks of 31st Tank Brigade were badly outgunned by tanks such as Tigers, so the thinly-armoured M10 Achilles of 86th A/T Rgt were sent up to give them covering fire with their long-range 17-pdrs. A sergeant of E Troop later complained that the regiment had spent three years training to defend captured ground, yet here they were being used in the offensive. E Troop accompanied C Squadron, 9th Royal Tank Regiment (9th RTR) attacking Éterville with 4th Dorsets. The attack went well, but it took the infantry longer than expected to winkle out the SS strongpoints. One of the open-topped M10s was knocked out by a mortar bomb. Meanwhile 7th RTR supported 129th Brigade's attack on Hill 112, the M10s dealing with a Tiger that had knocked out four Churchills, and then dealing with machine-guns nests. Tackling the strongly-defended crest of the hill the 17-pdrs of 86th's M10s were also useful support, some giving close support to the infantry, others standing back and engaging targets of opportunity. 130th Brigade's attack on Maltot went badly; 9th RTR's Churchills and the M10s were caught in a crossfire coming from the uncaptured part of Hill 112 and from beyond Éterville and took heavy casualties; 7th Hampshire Regiment got into the village but was almost destroyed. 4th Dorsets and E Troop of 86th A/T Rgt were sent to help, E Trp losing two more M10s, one to an airburst shell over the turret, the other to a direct hit by an 88mm gun. The remaining M10 took up a hull-down position to provide what support it could. A troop of towed 17-pdrs of 130 Bty was brought up to place an anti-tank screen round the south of the village while 4th Dorsets fought to suppress the strongpoints inside the village. The troop was overrun by a German counter-attack, and after firing all their small arms ammunition the crews had to remove the breechblocks from their guns and retreat to the infantry's slit trenches, losing half the troop in the process. The planned follow-up breakthrough by 4th Armoured Brigade was cancelled, and Maltot was evacuated, with few of the Dorsets or Hampshires getting back. At the end of the first day of bloody fighting day 43rd Division had Éterville and the northern half of Hill 112, while the Germans retained the southern half and Maltot, and the offensive fell into stalemate.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThis text discusses the unique status of Theseus in the cultic calendar of Athens and his representation of Athenian traits. Despite being born in Megara and being considered an outsider initially, Theseus became representative of essential Athenian qualities. It is suggested that his actions and journey to Crete came to symbolize the naval power of Athens after the Persian Wars. The text also highlights the dynamic nature of Athenian festivals, as new interpretations of founding myths can lead to new understandings of the festivals. The Pyanopsia festival, along with other Theseus-based Greek festivals, not only symbolically thanked Apollo for his actions and abundance in agriculture, but also represented the values of the founders. The text also mentions the worship of the Horae, the daughters of the goddess of divine law and order, at the Pyanopsia festival. This connection between the Horae and agriculture and vegetation is revealed through their worship at the Pyanopsia and another spring festival called the Thargelia.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: In the early 1990s the Autococker quickly rose to become one of the most popular markers used by top professional teams, used by such teams as Bob Long's original Ironmen. Although heavily criticized for reliability and a number of design defects, it proved to be an easy platform to work off and aftermarket parts soon appeared shortly after its inception. One of the most fundamental and important upgrades was the Palmer \"Rock\" low pressure regulator (LPR) to replace the troublesome stock LPR. With a variety of options appearing for parts, Belsales in the UK became the first company to build WGP-certified aftermarket cockers, called \"Evolution\" in 1993. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s, dozens of shops ranging from large notables such as Dave Youngblood Enterprises (Dye), Shocktech, Planet Eclipse, Belsales and FreeFlow down to small one man pro-shop operations made a business of servicing and customizing Autocockers with price tags of nearly $2000 for high-end models. A combination of performance, upgradeability and cosmetic options made it one of the top tournament markers of the 90's. Only the Automag rivaled it in popularity until electronic markers appeared. Indeed, the autococker was so ubiquitous that its barrel threading became one of the most commonly used standards on high-end markers (akin to how firearm cartridge sizes are often named for the first popular gun model or manufacturer to use them). To this day, most high-end markers, and many entry-level as well, accept barrels with \"autococker threads\".\n\nParagraph 2: E. nerine Frr. (= goante H Schaff (37 a, b). The upperside dark black-brown with slight gloss. The red-brown transverse band of the forewing is posteriorly interrupted by the veins, forming 3—4 basally somewhat pointed spots; sometimes the band is continuous, which is nearly always the case in the male. There are 2 white-centred black ocelli anteriorly in the band. The band is interrupted by the veins on the hindwing and bears 3 smaller ocelli. The forewing beneath bright russet-red, darker towards the base, the costal and distal margins being black-brown: the ocelli as above. The hindwing beneath dark brown as far as the centre, this area being bordered by a whitish grey narrow band which is somewhat sinuate near its centre; the ocelli in the lighter distal area are mostly indicated by small black-bordered white dots, which are sometimes absent. The ground-colour of the female is lighter, the band of the forewing broader and russet-yellow, the 2 eyes at the apex larger and usually confluent , there being often two additional smaller ocelli towards the hindmargin. The ocelli placed in the band of the hindwing are also larger and have conspicuous white pupils. The forewing beneath is light russet-yellow, darkened towards the base, the costal and distal margins grey-brown, the apex dusted with white-grey The hindwing beneath white grey irrorated with brown atoms; the white-grey band, which limits the dark basal area, contrasts distinctly. The fringes chequered in the female, the distal margin of the hindwing slightly dentate. In the Central and Southern Alps, northward to the Fern Pass and Scharnitz Valley. — reichlini H Schaff  (= styx Frr.), from the Bavarian Alps, Reichenhall and the Glockner district, is usually somewhat larger than the first described form. The band of the forewing is strongly reduced.

In South Tirol, Seiser Alp. — nerine flies in various dispersed localities, from the end of June to August in shady places of the forest region up to more than 5000 ft.\n\nParagraph 3: High Shincliffe can be characterised as a dormitory suburb of Durham City. There is a small, well-regarded, primary school, a recreational park with a playing field with equipment for young children, a public house, a public telephone box and several bus stops. There used to be a sub Post Office at Bank Top which also served as a small general store - since 2019 it has been Betty Bee's coffee shop. The nearest shops and Post Office are in Bowburn, about a mile to the south. The nearest public lending library is also in Bowburn, although the Clayport Library in Durham has a wider range of books and facilities.\n\nParagraph 4: Nonda's first major show was in 1952 at the Parnassus Gallery in Athens.  He exhibited a series of explicit nudes, violent, and highly erotic, crammed with images of Paris and its more liberated women, as well as the series of Femmes Chapeautées  which would be shown the same year at the Zaharias gallery.  The Parnassus show generated an immediate scandal.  Alongside the academic early work and the expressive cardboard models of Montmartre tenements, he hung a series of huge canvases depicting the end of love and youth, the sexual perversion of the misogynist, lesbian orgies, and the frightening satyr-lover figure which he used to portray himself.  The largest works were over three meters tall, executed on canvas in bold oil and completely dominated the space.  Interspersed were the smaller nudes in plaster frames. The opening was so shocking to certain Athenians that the police, urged by the board of directors at the Parnassus venue, immediately ordered the show closed and padlocked the doors. The charge was “offense of public decency”.  Like Modigliani's first one-man show in Paris, it had reached the classic impasse, the clash of a conservative authority with an independent and free thinking artist. In a sarcastic and historically loaded gesture, he collected an armful of fresh fig leaves from the suburbs and pinned a leaf over the genitalia of each of the figures. Others, considered even more offensive, were veiled with black curtains. With this new, somewhat comic amendment, the show reopened and as one would expect, the scandal generated a huge amount of attention by creating one of the first real censorship issues for a Greek artist in the Post war period.  The event was unprecedented in Athens, and the images, as well as the artist's response, captured the interest of the city. Here was a young artist reported to have made great advances in Paris,  and commanded the respect of more traditional artists such as Galanis and Vikatos, but with his first real show had managed to scandalize the city with art that was deemed by many to be dangerous, pornographic and “degenerate.” Thousands of viewers stood in lines that circled the block on Christou Lada Street to see the infamous nudes and the renaissance style “cover up”.   Even the controversial King Constantine and Queen Frederika paid a special visit to the show to view the paintings.  The Athenian newspapers were polarized on this issue of censorship and crammed with vitriolic letters by academics and other well known poets and writers as a drawn out debate concerning the art in question commenced.  In an open letter published in the national paper Nonda writes, “…my soul is filled with bitterness because I have found “Art on the Run” in the proverbial “City of Art and Culture”, I raise protest against the cultural and artistic circles in Athens.”  Spiros Vikatos, his former teacher in the Academy, stood by the young painter’s work and supported him against the attacks, as did other more progressive artists and writers such as the novelist Stratis Mirivilis, who wrote a heavily satiric article about the censors in the leading Athens newspaper.  These first shows in Athens, although scandalous, had also received rave reviews. There were articles in all the national Greek newspapers praising the remarkable Greek painter who was to “triumph in Paris” but the fiasco concerning his allegedly pornographic art was the beginning of a troubled relationship with the city of his birth.  Nonda was to prove difficult for the Athenian circles.\n\nParagraph 5: In a May 17, 2010, article in The Daily Bruin, writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both supporters and critics of the protest movement were increasing: \"The Facebook group is 35,000 strong. To compare, the anti-Draw Mohammed Day group is almost 30,000 strong. Both are gaining members rapidly.\" In a May 18, 2010 article, \"Why We're Having an Everybody Draw Mohammed Contest on Thursday May 20\", Reason editor Nick Gillespie explained: \"No one has a right to an audience or even to a sympathetic hearing, much less an engaged audience. But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion. If we cannot or will not defend that principle with a full throat, then we deserve to choke on whatever jihadists of all stripes can force down our throats.\" Gillespie asserted, \"Our Draw Mohammed contest is not a frivolous exercise of hip, ironic, hoolarious sacrilege toward a minority religion in the United States (though even that deserves all the protection that the most serioso political commentary commands). It's a defense of what is at the core of a society that is painfully incompetent at delivering on its promise of freedom, tolerance, and equal rights.\" As May 20, 2010, came closer, Molly Norris stated she was staying away from being directly involved in the protest movement. Norris told Dave Ross, \"I'm against my own concept becoming a reality.... If I had wanted to be taken seriously, I would be thrilled, but now I'm horrified because people did take it as an actual day. The one-off cartoon is not good as a long term plan because it's offensive.\" Fox News Channel reported that on May 19, 2010, a Facebook group supporting the protest movement had 41,000 members, and The Register reported this increased to 43,000 the same day. Norris told Fox News Channel in a statement on May 19, \"It's turned into something completely different, nothing I could've imagined it morphing into. I'm happy some people are talking, because obviously this needs to be addressed.\" By May 20, the Toronto Sun reported that both the \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" group and the \"Against 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'\" Facebook group protesting against the initiative had attracted more than 100,000 supporters, at 101,870 members and 106,000 members respectively.\n\nParagraph 6: A third club named Clydebank F.C. were formed in 1914. Playing their home games at Clydeholm they immediately joined the Scottish Football League, but by 1931 they had disbanded. In 1964 the owners of East Stirlingshire F.C., Jack and Charlie Steedman, merged the Falkirk-based team with Clydebank Juniors, naming the new entity East Stirlingshire Clydebank F.C.. ES Clydebank inherited East Stirlingshire's place in Division Two and played their home games at New Kilbowie. The merge, which was opposed by fans of both clubs, lasted only one season, with East Stirlingshire shareholders winning several court cases against it. East Stirlingshire reverted to its original legal status and moved back to Falkirk, parting company with the Steedman brothers.\n\nParagraph 7: The Air Force Fire Protection Badge is worn on the lower left breast pocket of a military uniform. The badge is similar in appearance to the Air Force Security Police Badge. The Fire Protection career field falls under Civil Engineering. All Air Force Fire Protection Specialists are also awarded the Civil Engineer Occupational Badge, which stays with the Airman throughout his or her career. Other branches of the U.S. military have not authorized a specific firefighter badge for wear of military uniforms.  Only Air Force personnel are authorized to wear a firefighter badge on Air Force uniforms (highly polished metal for dress uniforms, subdued green for BDU, subdued tan for DCU).\n\nParagraph 8: In the context of analyses of the soft power potential in Africa, Vogt accepted in February 2018 the invitation of the Personal Africa Representative of the Federal Chancellor and Africa Representative of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Günter Nooke, on a delegation journey \"On the Cultural and Religious Dimension of Sustainability\" to Ghana and Cameroon, and organized the return visit of twelve traditional authorities from sub-Saharan Africa (Cameroon, Benin, Gabon) to the Free State of Saxony in June 2018. In the run-up to a media public discussion between the Africa Representative and the Association of Professors in African Languages on 13 February 2019, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development asked Vogt for an assessment of the letter of 15 November 2018, addressed personally to the Federal Minister with numerous word mistakes and in which the Association had called for Nooke to be dismissed. Only the analysis, coordinated with two other colleagues, showed that the chairman of the association had copied an \"open letter\" from Cologne of 14.11.2018 (presumably a student's letter in view of the mistakes) by copy&paste and converted it into a personally addressed letter to the Federal Minister , using her official address at the University of Hamburg, without stating the copy&paste borrowing from students. This is problematic in the sense of the DFG guidelines on good scientific behaviour (quod licet bovi, non licet Iovi), but is at most an internal matter of the University of Hamburg, not of the Federal Government. The report therefore recommended not to inform the public about the assessment, only the Hamburg professor and her university. The BMZ's request of 08.02.2019 for an evaluation of the professors' association's letter was triggered by a press invitation of 07.02.2019 from the association which had not been coordinated with the BMZ. In this invitation, the chairman of the association had repeated the accusations of 15.11.2018, which was tantamount to a prejudgement of Nookes before the discussion and questioned the meaning of the discussion. In a concluding note Vogt summed up (following Thomas Bauer: Die Vereindeutigung der Welt, 2018): \"The 'causa' Nooke is exemplary for post-factual hypability, as it is called in New German. This means testing how - in a right-left shortening tunnel and detached from the factual situation - in our beautiful and perhaps precisely for this reason so often agitated country attention can be hedged. A fact-based MINT thinking like that of Günter Nooke, however, is not per se a right thinking, a humanities thinking open to polyvalences like that of the Africanists is not automatically a left thinking. And both are not incompatible either. In the theory of resilience, the Federal Republic finds itself in a highly dangerous, simplifying reduction and interlocking trap. The political extreme margins profit most from this trap\".\n\nParagraph 9: He appears in 1511 as a supporter of the pope against the claims of the Council of Pisa (1511–1512), called by dissident cardinals to punish Pope Julius II, who had ignored the electoral capitulations he had accepted before being elected.  Cajetan composed in defense of his position the Tractatus de Comparatione auctoritatis Papæ et conciliorum ad invicem. Jacques Almain answered this work, and Cajetan replied in his Apologia.  Cajetan refused to accept Almain's argument that the Church's polity had to be similar to a lay regime, complete with limits on the ruler. At the Fifth Lateran Council (1512–17) which Pope Julius II set up in opposition to that of Pisa, De Vio played the leading role. During the second session of the council, in which he gave the opening oration, he brought about a decree recognizing the superiority of papal authority to that of councils.\n\nParagraph 10: Kaelin was born on March 9, 1959, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Kaelin was nicknamed \"Kato\" as a child after the character played by Bruce Lee on the television series The Green Hornet. He graduated from Nicolet High School in Glendale, Wisconsin, in 1977. He attended, but never graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. He pledged the SAE Fraternity in the fall of 1980 and was accepted at the end of the term at California State University, Fullerton. During his time at Eau Claire he created his own talk show, Kato and Friends, and hosted The Gameshow on the campus television station, TV10. He eventually moved to Hollywood.\n\nParagraph 11:  1843: Alexander Keith, The Land of Israel, According to the Covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob: Palestine abounding in cultivated and flourishing regions, has several great cities which rival each other in their excellence, viz. Caesarea, Eleutheropolis, Neapolis, Askelon, and Gaza. The region beyond the Jordan, donominated Arabia, is rich in the variety of the merchandise of which it is full; it has besides other large towns the cities of Bostra, Gerasa, and Philadelphia, which the solidity of their walls renders most secure (Ammianus Marcellinus, lib. xiv. cap. viii.). [...] In Palestine, sesamum abounds, from which they procure oil, and dourra (a kind of pulse) as good as that of Egypt. Maize thrives in the light soil of Baalbec; and even rice is cultivated with success on the borders of the marshy countries of Havula. They have lately begun to cultivate sugar-canes in the gardens of Saide and of Beyrout, equal to those of the Delta. Indigo grows without cultivation on the banks of the Jordan, in the country of Bisan, and needs but care to improve the quality. Tobacco is now cultivated throughout all the mountains. As for trees, the olive of Provence grows at Antioch, and at Ramla, to the height of the beech. In the white mulberry-tree consists the wealth of the whole country of the Druses, by the beautiful silk which it produces; while the vine, supported by poles, or winding about the oaks, supplies grapes, which afford red and white wines equal to those of Bourdeaux. The water-melons of Jaffa are preferred before the very fine water melons of Broulas. Gaza produces dates like Mecca, and pomegranates like Algiers. Tripoli affords oranges like Malta. Beyrout, figs like Marseilles, and bananas like St Domingo. Aleppo has the (not) exclusive advantage of producing pistachios. And Damascus justly boasts of possessing all the fruits known in the provinces: its stony soil suits equally the apples of Normandy, the plums of Touraine, and the peaches of Paris. Twenty sorts of apricots aro enumerated there, the stone of one of which contains a kernel highly valued throughout Turkey. The cochineal plant, which grows on all that coast contains, perhaps, that precious insect in as high perfection as it is found in Mexico and St Domingo; and if we consider that the mountains of Yemen, which produce such excellent coffee are only a continuation of those of Syria, and that their soil and climate are almost the same, we shall be induced to believe that in Judea particularly, might be easily cultivated this valuable production of Arabia. \"With these advantages of climate and soil, it is not surprising that Syria should always have been reckoned a most delicious country and that the Greeks and Romans esteemed it among the most beautiful of their provinces and equal even to Egypt\" (Volney's Trav. vol. i. pp. 316–321. English translation).\n\nParagraph 12: The Royalist troops pursued fleeing troops from the battle into the town, and cut down and killed any men they found within it, according to the chronicler John Spalding, who was present. The violence went on for several days. Goods were looted, women raped, and at least 118 (according to Spalding) and perhaps as many as 160 (according to Alexander Jaffray, who was also at the battle) people were killed, including three members of the town council and a large number of tradesmen and ordinary residents. Spalding recorded that the townspeople eventually took to wearing a twist of oats in their bonnets, the Royalists' badge, in an attempt to deflect the attentions of the marauding troops. \"Ilk ane had in his cap or bonnet a rip of oats, whilk was his sign, our town's people began to wear the like in their bonnets, and to knit them to the knocks of our yetts, but it was little safeguard to us, albeit we used the same for a protection\". The episode did severe damage to the Royalist cause, particularly as Aberdeen had been in general sympathetic to the Royalists, and eliminated Montrose's chances of recruiting in the area. Despite the Royalist victory, this was probably the most significant outcome of the battle overall.\n\nParagraph 13: Avi has written 80 books, almost entirely for children and young adults. Along with The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, he has written books for different age groups and in many different genres including historical fiction, fantasies, graphic novels, comedies, mysteries, ghost stories, adventure tales, realistic fiction, and picture books.  Avi has won awards for some of his books, including a Newbery Honor for The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle in 1991 and another for Nothing but the Truth in 1992.  His fiftieth book, Crispin: The Cross of Lead, was awarded the Newbery Medal in 2003. Avi's book Iron Thunder, about the ironclad Monitor and its battle with the CSS Virginia in Hampton Roads, Virginia, was selected as the 2009 Beacon of Freedom Award winner by Williamsburg Regional Library and Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. In 2006, Avi wrote a sequel to Crispin:  The Cross of Lead  titled Crispin: At the Edge of the World. In the third part of the series, Crispin: The End of Time was published in 2010. His most recent novels, Catch You Later, Traitor and Old Wolf were met with critical success. In 2016, a collection of short stories was published by Candlewick Press, The Most Important Thing: Stories about Sons, Fathers, and Grandfathers.\n\nParagraph 14: In  and  Moses called on God to remember God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to deliver the Israelites from God's wrath after the incident of the Golden Calf. Similarly, God remembered Noah to deliver him from the flood in ; God promised to remember God's covenant not to destroy the Earth again by flood in ; God remembered Abraham to deliver Lot from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in ; God remembered Rachel to deliver her from childlessness in ; God remembered God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage in  and ; God promised to \"remember\" God's covenant with Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham to deliver the Israelites and the Land of Israel in ; the Israelites were to blow upon their trumpets to be remembered and delivered from their enemies in ; Samson called on God to deliver him from the Philistines in ; Hannah prayed for God to remember her and deliver her from childlessness in 1 Samuel  and God remembered Hannah's prayer to deliver her from childlessness in ; Hezekiah called on God to remember Hezekiah's faithfulness to deliver him from sickness in  and ; Jeremiah called on God to remember God's covenant with the Israelites to not condemn them in ; Jeremiah called on God to remember him and think of him, and avenge him of his persecutors in ; God promises to remember God's covenant with the Israelites and establish an everlasting covenant in ; God remembers the cry of the humble in Zion to avenge them in Psalm; David called upon God to remember God's compassion and mercy in ; Asaph called on God to remember God's congregation to deliver them from their enemies in ; God remembered that the Israelites were only human in ; Ethan the Ezrahite called on God to remember how short Ethan's life was in ; God remembers that humans are but dust in ; God remembers God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in ; God remembers God's word to Abraham to deliver the Israelites to the Land of Israel in ; the Psalmist calls on God to remember him to favor God's people, to think of him at God's salvation, that he might behold the prosperity of God's people in ; God remembered God's covenant and repented according to God's mercy to deliver the Israelites in the wake of their rebellion and iniquity in ; the Psalmist calls on God to remember God's word to God's servant to give him hope in ; God remembered us in our low estate to deliver us from our adversaries in ; Job called on God to remember him to deliver him from God's wrath in ; Nehemiah prayed to God to remember God's promise to Moses to deliver the Israelites from exile in ; and Nehemiah prayed to God to remember him to deliver him for good in .\n\nParagraph 15: The son of Jean, Duke of Guise, Henri was forbidden to enter France for much of his life. Nonetheless, he remained devoted to serving France, having enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and fighting in World War II and the Algerian War. After being permitted to re-enter France in 1950, he soon became heavily engaged in French monarchist politics. Henri worked to restore the French monarchy, in a parliamentary form, and discussed the topic with Charles de Gaulle. He received notable support from French monarchists, but all attempts to restore the monarchy ultimately failed. Upon his death in 1999, his son Henri succeeded him as Head of the House of Orléans.\n\nParagraph 16: In the 1820s and 1830s immigrants from New England began moving to what is now Michigan in large numbers (though there was a trickle of New England settlers who arrived before this date). These were \"Yankee\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the colonial era.  While most of them came to Michigan directly from New England, there were many who came from upstate New York. These were people whose parents had moved from New England to upstate New York in the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution. Due to the prevalence of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York, Michigan was very culturally contiguous with early New England culture for much of its early history. The Yankee migration to Michigan was a result of several factors, one of which was the overpopulation of New England. The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household.  Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead.  As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the Midwestern United States.  This resulted in Michigan's population expanding rapidly in the 1820s.  The Erie Canal caused such an upsurge in immigration from New England that by 1837 \"it seemed as if all New England were coming\" according to one pioneer.  New England families considered it a route to the \"promised land\".  As a result of this heritage, the New England element of Michigan's population would remain culturally and politically dominant for a long time.\n\nParagraph 17: Hank the Cowdog is a long-running, ongoing series of children's books written by John R. Erickson and illustrated by Gerald L. Holmes. The books follow Hank, a dog that views himself as the \"Head of Ranch Security\". Hank suffers a superiority complex, and thinks he is smarter than everybody else. His intelligence is limited to that of the average dog. In each book Hank and other characters must deal with several events, issues and mysteries that occur at their Texas Panhandle home in Ochiltree County. The name of the ranch is never mentioned in any of the stories.  The series began in 1982, with a couple of short stories about Hank and his friends; since then, 79 printed books and seven audio-only books have been published. Hank the Cowdog was previously  published via Maverick Books, with Puffin Books holding the current American publishing rights in English.  Each book features songs that Erickson performs on the audiobook editions. The series has received awards and critical acclaim, and the books have sold more than eight million copies worldwide. It has been published in several languages including Spanish, Danish, Persian, and Chinese. In the 1980s, the first book was adapted into an animated segment for CBS Storybreak.\n\nParagraph 18: The fudai Sakai clan originated in 14th century Mikawa Province. They claim descent from Minamoto no Arichika. Arichika had two sons; one of them, Yasuchika, took the name of Matsudaira, while the other son, Chikauji, took the name of Sakai. Chikauji is the ancestor of the Sakai clan. Sakai Hirochika, Chikauji's son, had two sons as well, and the descendants of these two sons gave rise to the two principal branches of the clan. The senior branch was founded by Sakai Tadatsugu (1527–1596). Tadatsugu, a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu, was charged with the defense of Yoshida Castle in Mikawa Province. In 1578, Sakai Ietsugu (1564–1619) succeeded to his father's role as defender of Yoshida Castle.  The Ie- in the beginning of Ietsugu's name was a special honor bestowed by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who intended to emphasize bonds of loyalty with those who were allowed to share in any part of his name. When Ieyasu's holdings were transferred to the Kantō region in 1590, Ietsugu was installed at Usui Domain (30,000 koku) in Kōzuke Province, but, in 1604, he was moved to Takasaki Domain (50,000 koku). In 1616, he was again moved to Takada Domain (100,000 koku), this time in Echigo Province. In 1619, he was moved to Matsushiro Domain in Shinano Province; and then, from 1622 to 1868, he was installed at Tsuruoka Domain (120,000 koku) in Dewa Province. The Sakai of Tsuruoka (which later grew to 170,000 koku) in Dewa Province were prominent in the late Edo period as a military power. Charged with the safety of Edo, they were patrons of the Shinchogumi police force, and were very effective in their duties. Following the surrender of Edo, the Sakai withdrew and returned north to their domain, where they were active in the northern theater of the Boshin War, as well as becoming signatories to the pact that created the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei in 1868. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \"Count\" in the Meiji period.\n\nParagraph 19: After much speculation about whether or not the Silverbacks would leave the CIFL and join the Ultimate Indoor Football League, the Silverbacks management made an announcement that they would be staying in the CIFL and helping the league rebuild after losing its top two teams from the 2011 season. Coach Derrick Shepard resigned at the end of the 2011 season. On September 8, 2011, Mister Askew was named the 6th coach in Silverbacks history. On February 9, 2012, it was announced that Silverbacks Football LLC, in which Jeff Kolaczkowski of Dayton acted as president of that organization, decided they would be stepping out of the world of football and selling the team to an ownership group. The Dayton Silverbacks were sold to MRL Sports Entertainment LLC. There are currently three members on the ownership board for MRL Sports Entertainment LLC and all three board members were current members of the Dayton Silverbacks front office staff. Those members were Michael Lause, April Shellenberger and Tyree Fields. On March 1, just ten days before the season started, the Silverback fired Head Coach Mister Askew. The reasons for his termination have yet to be determined. The team hired James Scott, a former player for the Silverbacks, and Askew's Defensive Coordinator, to be the team's Head Coach. More trouble came before the season started, as Fields left the team in all capacities, leaving only Lause and Shellenberger. Then after one week of the season, Lause left the team as well for reasons that are unknown. Shelleberger was left as the lone person in charge and eventually reached out to a silent partial owner, Corwyn Thomas, to help provide financial support to get the team through the season. Corwyn stepped in and paid the absolute bare minimum to get things done, even making the team travel in a school bus to the championship game. Despite all the off the field distractions, the Silverbacks put together the best season in franchise history, clinching a winning record for the first time ever with a 62-15 win of the Indianapolis Enforcers on April 14. The Silverbacks would finish the season 8-1, with their lone loss coming to the undefeated Saginaw Sting. Their second-place finish was critical after the CIFL cut the playoffs from 4 teams to just 2, moving the Silverbacks into the 2012 CIFL Championship Game against the Sting. Silverbacks scored just 7 points, in what was the lowest scoring CIFL Championship Game in league history, with a final score of 7-35. After all the success the team had through the season, Mr Thomas decided he didn’t want to continue utilizing the Silverback name in an attempt to distance himself from financial obligations left by Michael Lause of MRL Entertainment. Corwyn folded the Silverback name and switched to the Dayton Sharks name and then fired the GM and attempted to strap her with the leftover Silverback debts.\n\nParagraph 20: Contrary to the 1950s, the 1970s are considered an era of \"artistic travesti 'uncover'\" (Spanish: \"destape\"), which began with the arrival of a Brazilian travesti who performed in a well-known theater in Buenos Aires. Her show paved the way door to later performances by local travestis. According to Solís, the use of the term travesti began to be used in the 1960s, initially as a way to refer to the cross-dressing and transsexual performers who came from abroad to do shows. In 1963, French entertainer Coccinelle visited Buenos Aires to perform at the Teatro Maipo and made a big impact among local mariconas. Solís told researcher María Soledad Cutuli in 2013: \"Beginning with Coccinelle (...) there is a whole opening, something new that is coming. A lot of 'siliconized' [performers] came, plastic surgeries; social openness, (...) new opportunities for mariconas, 'the travesti artist' is inaugurated. (...) From then on a new way of life opened. (...) The culture of the puto artist, all of them were already walking around with cotton stuffing to make their breasts, and they were already going out to sing, to dance...\" The stage became the only place where travestis could publicly dress as women, as it was forbidden to do so on the streets. Around 1964, travesti artists—at that time named lenci, in reference to a type of cloth, because they \"were like little rag dolls\"—met at an apartment on Avenida Callao, where they rehearsed musical acts and prepared to go out to nightclubs or theaters shows. Since the use of silicone had not yet become widespread, they resorted to the use of female hormones to \"be able to show their breasts on stage as aesthetically as possible\". According to writer Daniela Vizgarra: \"If you didn't have an Anovlar 21 in your makeup bag, apparently you were nonexistent.\" Travestis emulated a contoured figure—which emphasized breasts and buttocks—through paddings called truquis, piu-piú or colchón (), first using cotton fabrics and later foam rubber. While padding had been in use since at least the 1950s, the arrival of lycra in the 1960s allowed them to \"build more realistic physical contours.\" The feminine beauty ideal put forward by American television also included small and pointed noses but, as surgeries were too expensive, most travestis settled for temporary arrangements, resorting to the use of glue and objects that could emulate a prosthesis. María Belén Correa argues that the emergence of travesti stage performers such Vanessa Show, Evelyn, Brigitte Gambini and Ana Lupe Chaparro in the 1960s and 1970s constituted \"another way of activism\". According to Evelyn—one of the first people to popularize transformismo in the theater scene—the \"first travestis to appear in Buenos Aires\" were a group called Les Girls in 1972, followed by Vanessa Show and Ana Lupez. She also mentioned the travestis of the \"following era\", which included Graciela Scott, Claudia Prado and herself, who debuted in 1977.\n\nParagraph 21: This disaster affected a total of fourteen regions. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise 572 islands (land masses at low and high tide), of which 38 are inhabited by people from the mainland and indigenous tribes. The islands were just north of the earthquake epicentre, and the tsunami reached a height of  in the southern Nicobar Islands. The official death toll was 1,310, with about 5,600 missing. The unofficial death toll (including those missing and presumed dead) was estimated at 7,000. This ocean earthquake goes down in history as the deadliest of all time. It took the lives of over 230,000 victims throughout the fourteen regions and wounded more than double this number.\n\nParagraph 22: In the reign of Catherine I, he became a member of the Supreme Privy Council, which had the chief conduct of affairs during this and the succeeding reigns. The empress also entrusted him with her last will whereby she appointed the young Peter II her successor and Golovkin one of his guardians. On the death of Peter II in 1730, he declared openly in favour of Anna, duchess of Courland, in opposition to the aristocratic Dolgorukovs and Galitzines, and his determined attitude on behalf of autocracy was the chief cause of the failure of the proposed constitution, which would have converted Russia into a limited monarchy. Under Anna, he was a member of the first cabinet formed in Russia, but had less influence in affairs than Osterman and Munnich.\n\nParagraph 23:  Collision avoidance AIS was developed by the IMO technical committees as a technology to avoid collisions among large vessels at sea that are not within range of shore-based systems. The technology identifies every vessel individually, along with its specific position and movements, enabling a virtual picture to be created in real time. The AIS standards include a variety of automatic calculations based on these position reports such as Closest Point of Approach (CPA) and collision alarms. As AIS is not used by all vessels, AIS is usually used in conjunction with radar. When a ship is navigating at sea, information about the movement and identity of other ships in the vicinity is critical for navigators to make decisions to avoid collision with other ships and dangers (shoal or rocks). Visual observation (e.g., unaided, binoculars, and night vision), audio exchanges (e.g., whistle, horns, and VHF radio), and radar or automatic radar plotting aid are historically used for this purpose. These preventive mechanisms sometimes fail due to time delays, radar limitations, miscalculations, and display malfunctions, and can result in a collision. While requirements of AIS are to display only very basic text information, the data obtained can be integrated with a graphical electronic chart or a radar display, providing consolidated navigational information on a single display.\n\nParagraph 24: Starting in 1938, the FCC created 6 MHz wide television channel allocations working around the 5-meter amateur band with channel 2 occupying 50–56 MHz. In 1940, television channel 2 was reallocated to 60 MHz and TV channel 1 was moved to 50–56 MHz maintaining a gap for the 5-meter amateur band. When the US entered World War II, transmissions by amateur radio stations were suspended for the duration of the war. After the war, the 5-meter band was briefly reopened to amateurs from 56–60 MHz until March 1, 1946. At that time the FCC moved television channel 2 down to 54–60 MHz and reallocated channel 1 down to 44–50 MHz opening a gap that would become the Amateur radio 6-meter band in the United States. FCC Order 130-C went into effect at 3 am Eastern Standard Time on March 1, 1946, and created the 6-meter band allocation for the amateur service as 50–54 MHz. Emission types A1, A2, A3 and A4 were allowed for the entire band and special emission for Frequency modulation telephony was allowed from 52.5 to 54 MHz.\n\nParagraph 25: Following his studies in Montpellier l'Obel set up a medical practice in England (1566–1571), living initially in London, and then in Somerset, near Bristol at the home of his patron, Edward St. Loe. There he was joined in botanical expeditions by Clusius.  On his return to continental Europe, he practised in Antwerp (1571–1581) and then Delft (1581–1584). The period from 1571 to 1596, after his return from England, was one of the most productive in his life, with two major publications. Delft had been the residence of William, Prince of Orange (William the Silent) since 1572, and became the capital of the newly independent Netherlands in 1581. In Delft l'Obel served as personal physician (hofarts) to the Protestant Prince William. The exact date of this appointment is uncertain, but his Kruydtboeck (1581) is dedicated to the Prince, and the title page describes l'Obel as Medecijn der Princ. suggesting it was some time between returning to the Low Countries in 1571 and 1581. His name also appears on a list of court personnel dated 1578. William, however, was assassinated in 1584. Claims that after William's death, l'Obel was employed by the Estates General, the governing body of the Netherlands, have been disputed. Following the assassination l'Obel became a city physician in Middelburg, which was then a prosperous centre of trade and capital of the province of Zeeland. He was responsible for the establishment of a botanical herb garden there, and would have known Ambrosius Bosschaert (1573–1621), the artist, best known for his meticulous flower paintings, who was a member and eventually dean of the Saint Luke’s Guild in Middelburg.\n\nParagraph 26: Far from denying his South American roots and musical background, including elements from Argentina’s rich folk music and rhythms, Micháns regards them as components of his personality, although not essential to his musical language. On the other hand, sustained exposure to new music from all over the world rarely heard in Argentina, would result in a gradual updating of his regular style (strongly influenced by the free and aggressive dissonances of Bartók and Prokofiev), without breaking with tradition altogether. Never interested in experimentation for its own sake, he nevertheless adopted certain aspects of serialism and minimalism, discovered the music of Olivier Messiaen, Witold Lutoslawski and Henri Dutilleux (to name just a few) and blended his findings into a uniform and distinctive style of his own. More recently, he has added a few Asian elements to his palette, as a result of his frequent visits (both privately and on tour with other musicians) to India and Indonesia. This is particularly evident in his Sinfonia Concertante Nr. 4, the choral work Tirthankara, Purana for saxophone and piano and Dradivian Moods for oboe and string quartet. In his view, any style, culture or period may supply useful material and enrich the grammar of music, and it is up to the composer to select and combine the elements most suited to his needs, in order to configure a widely accessible, yet personal and distinctive language. This new approach is clear in one of Micháns' major piano works, Apparitions, composed for the outstanding Dutch pianist Ronald Brautigam in 1990 and which the composer himself regards as a turning point in his creative career. A few years earlier than Apparitions, the Magnificat for soprano and choir also reflects Micháns' affinity with vocal music and his former training as a choir conductor. Combining rich, dissonant harmonies and a counterpoint with strong roots in polyphonic tradition, it is the first of a long series of works which would gradually establish his name in the Netherlands' rich choral life. Writing almost exclusively on commission, Micháns' output since his arrival in the Netherlands has grown steadily. At present, his catalog includes works for all sorts of instrumental combinations, from solos to major compositions for choir and orchestra. His list of chamber and choral music features a number of titles regularly performed by Dutch and international musicians and ensembles. Several of his compositions, which are published in The Hague by Donemus, have been released on CD. Among the musicians and ensembles of international stature which have performed music by Carlos Micháns are: Isabelle van Keulen (vl.), Ronald Brautigam (pn.), Michael Collins (cl.), Liza Ferschtman (vl.), Tjeerd Top (vl.) Dmitry Ferschtman (vc.), Remy van Kesteren (harp), Arno Bornkamp (sax.), Pieter Wispelwey (vc.), Marcio Carneiro (vc.), Lavinia Meijer (hp.), Udo Reinemann (baritone), Thierry Fischer (cond.), Kenneth Montgomery (cond.), Etienne Siebens (cond.), Utrecht String Quartet, Aurelia Saxophone Quartet, Duo Imaginaire (clarinet & harp), Het Reizend Muziekgezelschap (Amsterdam Chamber Music Society), Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, Orkest van het Oosten, Radio Kamer Filharmonie, Groot Omroepkoor (the major choir of the Dutch Broadcasting Company), Holland Symfonia and Hagen Philharmonisches Orchester (Germany).\n\nParagraph 27: O it's owre the border awa', awaIt's owre the border awa', awa'''We'll on an' we'll march to Carlisle haWi' its yetts, its castle an' a', an a'.Chorus:Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',We'll up an' gie them a blaw, a blawWi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a'.O! our sodger lads looked braw, looked braw,Wi' their tartan kilts an' a', an' a',Wi' their bonnets an' feathers an' glitt'rin' gear,An' pibrochs sounding loud and clear.Will they a' return to their ain dear glen?Will they a' return oor Heilan' men?Second sichted Sandy looked fu' wae.An' mithers grat when they march'd away.Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',We'll up an' gie them a blaw, a blawWi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a'.O! wha' is foremos o' a', o' a',Oh wha' is foremost o' a', o' a',Bonnie Charlie the King o' us a', hurrah!Wi' his hundred pipers an' a', an ' a'.His bonnet and feathers he's waving high,His prancing steed maist seems to fly,The nor' win' plays wi' his curly hair,While the pipers play wi'an unco flare.Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',We'll up an' gie them a blaw, a blawWi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a'.The Esk was swollen sae red an' sae deep,But shouther to shouther the brave lads keep;Twa thousand swam owre to fell English groundAn' danced themselves dry to the pibroch's sound.Dumfoun'er'd the English saw, they saw,Dumfoun'er'd they heard the blaw, the blaw,Dumfoun'er'd they a' ran awa', awa',Frae the hundred pipers an' a', an' a'.Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',Wi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a',We'll up an' gie them a blaw, a blawWi' a hundred pipers, an' a', an' a'.See also\n\nParagraph 28: According to Robert Vane Russell, many gotras of Hindu religion are of totemic origin which is named after plants, animals, and natural objects. These are universal among tribes but occur also in Hindu castes. The commonest totem names are those of animals, including several which are held sacred by Hindus, as bagh or Nahar, the tiger; bachhas, the calf; murkuria, the peacock; kachhua, the tortoise; nagas, the cobra; hathi, the elephant; bhains, the buffalo; richaria, the bear; Kuliha, the Jackal, Kukura, the dog; kursaal, the deer; Hiran, the black-buck and so on. The utmost variety of names is found, and numerous trees, as well as rice and other crops, salt, sandalwood, cucumber, pepper, and some household implements such as pestle, rolling slab, serve as the names of clans. Thus the name of the rishi Bharadvaja means a lark bird, and Kaushika means descended from Kusha grass, Agastya from Agassi flower, Kashyapa from kachhap a tortoise, Taittiri from titer, partridge bird. Similarly, the origin of other rishis is attributed to animals, Rishyasringa to an antelope, Mandavya to a frog, Kanada to an owl. The usual characteristic of totemism is that the members of a clan regard themselves as related to or descended from, the animals or trees from which the clan takes its name, and abstain from killing or eating them.\n\nParagraph 29: Following their breakaway, George of Poděbrady secretly supported their invasion into the Comitatus of Nitra and their occupation of the fort of Kosztolány, as the army was composed of Bohemian-Moravian professionals previously in service for George and Frederick III. Apart from the militia, there were religious outcasts (considered heretics) looking for shelter, including Hussite Bratriks (\"Brothers\" – Hussites in Slovakia/Upper Hungary) and rogue Žebraks who favoured pillaging instead of payment. Svehla established an ad hoc fort, and he appointed Jorig Lichtenburger and Vöttau as comeses for the county. The fort and its looting inhabitants had a surrounding sphere of influence ranging from the valleys of Váh and Nitra to the eastern provinces of Austria. Matthias realized the threat and ordered two of his \"upper-land\" captains to besiege Kosztolany, namely Stephen Zápolya and Ladislaus Podmaniczky. After returning from Slavonia, the king joined the siege. It is worth mentioning that here, among few occasions, Matthias cooperated with Frederick. He sent a strong-armoured mounted troop led by commander Ulrich von Grafeneck to help wipe out these brigades. When he reached Pozsony (Bratislava), he was reinforced by Knight Georg Pottendorfer with his 600 crusader cavalry. This totaled 8–10 thousand people ready to besiege, who began an assault after taking some minor fortifications on 1 January 1467. The vanguards of the Black Army officers were all present against their former ally. They included the Palatine Michael Ország, Jan Jiskra, Jan Haugwitz, Balázs Magyar, Pál Kinizsi, Nicholaus Ujlaki Ban of Macsó (Mačva), and Peter Sobi Ban of Bosnia-Croatia-Dalmatia, with the latter-most dying in the assault. Before the siege began, Matthias offered Švehla the chance to return to his service in exchange for an unconditional surrender on all grounds. After a refusal, he immediately began the siege and the cannon firing despite the harsh winter conditions. Švehla and his 2,500 men (and additional citizens) resisted the superior besiegers, but food storages reached extremely low levels and all the efforts to break out were unsuccessful, so he decided to capitulate twice to Matthias with the aforementioned taking his revenge in rejecting it. After three weeks, Švehla feigned a breakout attempt in the front while getting out from the rear through a water channel. Though his physically weak and exhausted entourage of 2,000 infantry tried to elude the besieging forces, they were not fast enough to escape safely. Balázs Magyar and Pál Kinizsi rode down to the fort of Csejte (Čachtice), where they clashed. Almost all of the rioters fell, only 250 taken as prisoners. Svehla evaded capture again but was put in custody by peasants by the time he was too debilitated to fight.\n\nParagraph 30: Returning to England from the tour, Heseltine became a regular member of the Hampshire team. He featured for them fifteen times in 1897, in which he took 41 wickets at an average of 17.29, which included two five wicket hauls. He followed this up with thirteen appearances in 1898 and 25 wickets. However, his best season in terms of number of wickets taken was to be the last in which he regularly featured for Hampshire, with his fourteen appearances in 1899 bringing him 45 wickets, which included his career best figures of 7 for 106 against Derbyshire. He next played for Hampshire in the 1901 County Championship, taking his seventh and final five wicket haul during that season. Heseltine's appearances for Hampshire became less frequent thereafter, with three appearances in 1902 and one apiece in 1903 and 1904. After the turn of the century he appeared in three further first-class matches for the MCC, playing twice in 1902 and once in 1914 against Hampshire at Lord's, which came ten years after his last first-class match. Heseltine also made one appearance for I Zingari in first-class cricket, against the Gentlemen of England in 1904. Playing primarily as a bowler, he made 79 appearances in first-class cricket, taking 170 wickets at an average of 24.50. Wisden noted how by \"fully utilising his height, he brought the ball over at the extreme extent of his arm with deadly effect at times\", whilst commenting that at occasion \"he was inconsistent and required careful nursing because apt to tire\". Lord Hawke was of the opinion that he was considered a bowler who sacrificed length for pace. As a right-handed batsman, he scored 1,390 runs at an average of 12.30; he scored three half centuries, with a highest score of 77. Amongst his most notable feats in first-class cricket was to dismiss Bobby Abel for three successive ducks.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nAccording to Robert Vane Russell, many gotras (clans) in the Hindu religion have names that originate from plants, animals, and natural objects. These totemic names are common among tribes but also exist in Hindu castes. The most common totem names are animals, including those that are considered sacred by Hindus. There is a wide variety of names, including trees, crops, salt, and household objects. The names of certain rishis (sages) are also associated with animals and plants. The characteristic of totemism is that members of a clan see themselves as related to the animals or trees from which the clan gets its name and refrain from killing or eating them.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

More than 60 cannons (some of them British cannons the French had captured at Fort Oswego) were found, as were hundreds of barrels of provisions.  To the many provincials in Bradstreet's army, the biggest prizes were bales of furs destined for shipment downstream to Montreal.  In all, the value of the captured goods was estimated to be 800,000 French livres.  Since Bradstreet's orders were not to hold the fort but to destroy it, many of the provisions were burned before the army returned to Oswego, using some of the captured French ships to help carry the loot.  Bradstreet released the French prisoners after Noyan promised to gain the release of an equal number of British prisoners, and the French began to make their way back to Montreal.  They were met by the relief force from Montreal.  The French established Fort de La Présentation (at present-day Ogdensburg, New York) as a base for supply and defense.  Fort Frontenac was again lightly garrisoned in 1759, but was no longer a site of importance in the war, which ended with the fall of Montreal in September 1760.\n\nParagraph 2: The first person to accomplish powered flight in the UK was Alliot Verdon Roe in June 1908, who also flew an aeroplane of his own design, but this had not yet been achieved in Ireland. Ferguson began to develop a keen interest in the mechanics of flying and travelled to several air shows, including exhibitions in 1909 at Blackpool and Rheims where he took notes of the design of early aircraft. Harry convinced his brother that they should attempt to build an aircraft at their Belfast workshop and working from Harry's notes, they worked on the design of a plane, the Ferguson monoplane.\n\nParagraph 3:  \"A Talk in the Park\": In a park, the same in which Gosforth's Fete took place, sit five strangers on separate park benches, each with their own troubles. Arthur, a rather suspect fellow with an interest in cigarette card collecting and women-watching, sits next to Beryl and starts to relate his story of his likes and dislikes. Beryl is understandably quite disturbed by this, and proceeds in leaving her current bench and going to sit with Charles. Beryl is a young woman with a husband who beats her, and so she tells Charles this story and reads out a letter from the \"bastard\". Charles becomes quite sick of hearing this, so excuses himself and goes to sit next to man-hating dog-loving Doreen. Charles is an old business man on the verge of bankruptcy and so has no time for the youth of today. He reminisces on a happier time with his wife and children and asks Doreen to help him decipher his business report. Doreen is at this point very scared of the man who she thinks is perving on her, and so she sits next to Ernest. Ernest at this point is happily relaxing on his bench and so is very annoyed with being disturbed by a paranoid woman who starts to harp on about her dog. Doreen relates the story of taking her dog to the vets to get the snip, which is not a topic Ernest is interested in so he sneaks off leaving Doreen talking to herself. Ernest then collapses on the bench where Arthur is and proceeds in taking it over whilst moaning about his wife. The scene ends with each character trying to get the attention of the person they were trying to talk to, but failing. The end result is five miserable people who are all feeling ignored, despite the fact that it is their own fault for ignoring everyone else.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1909, Shichizaemon Yuasa established Yuasa Iron Works to modernize the family business, founded in 1666 as a charcoal trading business. Yuasa Iron Works began producing storage batteries in 1915, and three years later Yuasa Storage Battery Co., Ltd was established. Soon after, Yuasa Storage Battery Co., Ltd began making Japan's first automotive batteries. In 1925, Yuasa began making dry cells, and in 1941 they began making alkaline cells. The dry battery business was later spun off into Yuasa Dry Battery Co., Ltd, which later merged back into Yuasa Storage Battery Co., Ltd to form Yuasa Battery Co, Ltd, later renamed to Yuasa Corporation.\n\nParagraph 5: Escapology is the fifth studio album recorded by British singer-songwriter Robbie Williams. It was released on 18 November 2002 through EMI Records. The album features a guest appearance by singer Rose Stone and was produced by Guy Chambers and Steve Power. Escapology was preceded by the lead single \"Feel\", which was released on 2 December 2002. The track was an international hit, reaching the top of the charts in Austria, Poland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and top five positions in countries such as Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Three other singles from the album were released: \"Come Undone\", \"Something Beautiful\" and \"Sexed Up\".\n\nParagraph 6: The campus consists of a mix of Classical revival buildings designed by architect Stanford White in 1892-1901 – including the Hall of Languages, the Cornelius Baker Hall of Philosophy and the Gould Memorial Library – and Brutalist concrete buildings by Marcel Breuer, including Begrisch Hall (1956–61) and the Colston Residence Hall and Cafeteria (1964). Other buildings – such as South Hall, formerly the Gustav H. Schwab House (1857); Butler Hall, formerly William Henry W. T. Mall House (c.1859); and MacCracken Hall, originally the Loring Andrews House (c.1880) – are repurposed mansions which predate the campus. The original landscaping for the campus was by Vaux & Co.  The complex of Stanford White buildings, judged one of the finest concentrations of Beaux Arts architecture in the US, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012.\n\nParagraph 7: But the major novelty in this phase is the development of a new religious iconography with the emergence of Christianity. Paleo-Christian paintings do not achieve a relevant visibility until after the second century. In the first place because at their beginning they were only grooves created by a small and generally uneducated group with scarce artistic resources, but also because early Christianity shared much of the Jewish aversion to image-making. Paulinus of Nola, a wealthy Christian of the third century, still had to justify himself for having images of living beings painted on the walls of the churches he had rebuilt, saying that,Most of the crowd here cannot read. These people, long accustomed to profane cults, in which their womb was their God, are finally converted into proselytes of Christ as they admire the works of Christ's saints revealed (by the paintings) to everyone's eyes. See how so many gather from all parts and how they now gaze in wonder at the scenes with their pious but rude minds (...) Therefore, it seemed to us a useful work joyfully to embellish the houses of (St.) Felix with paintings on all sides ...Moreover, at times this religion faced persecutions that prevented an artistic flourishing, and even when it was made official by the empire the most distinguished Christians still appreciated the classical culture and its formal models derived from paganism. For them it was relatively easy to reinterpret the ancient myths in the form of allegories, and to apply them to the new cult, and in this sense pagan representations were still acceptable as a means of spreading moralizing maxims and as a link with the pagans in the common belief in an afterlife. This association between Christianity and paganism was already visible in a veiled way in St. Paul's writings, where allusions to the majesty of Christ abound, and which were a clear transposition to a new context of the imperial apologies of Augustus' time. Not surprisingly, in the Paleochristian imagery Christ could be represented in the same way as Apollo, the sun god, illuminating the world, as Orpheus pacifying the \"beasts\" (pagans) with his \"music\" (doctrine), or as a classical philosopher teaching his disciples the secrets of the new philosophy. With the progressive rise of the prestige of Christianity, these elements acquired more weight in late-imperial Roman culture. The first examples of paleo-Christian painting are found in the catacombs, and the motifs are the same as in pagan decorations: garlands of flowers, animals, cupids, allegories, and human figures of ambiguous meaning. Some of them are clearer, showing people in prayer and the symbolic figures of the fish and the Good Shepherd. In the third century, scenes from the Gospels, the Old Testament and Christian legends appear, but their style and quality are very uneven. At the end of the third century, lightness and grace give way to a remodeling of the classical canons, and in the following century a different aesthetic is already outlined, heavier, schematic and with an abstracting tendency, which would lead to the formation of the Byzantine style, with Constantinople as its main center of irradiation. When Christianity received official support with the Edict of Milan in 313, a program of building many churches and basilicas began, whose internal decorations constitute the most important artistic achievement of the late Imperial period. Although their walls and domes were often covered with mosaics, a technique which quickly entered into the general taste for decoration of Christian temples, in others fresco was preferred, and since such temples were erected with the patronage of the elite, if not the imperial family itself, the level of quality far surpassed the primitive painting of the catacombs, and it is to be regretted that practically all such works disappeared in later reforms.\n\nParagraph 8: The book tells the story of Juan who lives in an adobe house which is located near Mission San Juan Capistrano. It isn't too far from the school. In fact, Juan is good friends with Julian who's an old bell ringer and a gardener that isn't sure about the swallows' migration to a peaceful island in the summer. Julian explains to Juan how this beautiful mission was founded by Saint Francis and his brothers, especially Father Junipero Serra. He also explains to the Spanish lad how unsure he is about the swallow family's migration. Juan and Julian really love the swallows (las golondrinas) very much and doesn't want them to leave Mission San Juan Capistrano. He and his friend feed tiny pieces of bread that Julian saves in his pockets. Plenty of birds appear in the garden including hummingbirds, sparrows, white doves and especially swallows. In the spring, he plants a garden on his vacation time. There's nothing more exciting to see the family of swallows nesting in the protagonist's very own garden.  One of the children tells the other the amazing journey the swallows make all the way from South America to spend the summer in California during St. Joseph's Day to watch a family of swallows migrate far away from San Juan Capistrano to a peaceful island. On Saint Joseph's Day, Juan's dream comes true which gets to the point where Juan and Julian alert everyone in the village by ringing the bells of Mission San Juan Capistrano together. The swallow family gets to nest in the arches of the mission after all before summer begins. One day, a baby swallow falls out of the nest and Juan witnesses the shock of the situation with his feathered friends. His/her parents don't reject the chick at all after Juan saved him/her. Everyone gets ready for Saint Joseph's Day by dressing up and celebrating before summer arrives in the village. Juan sings \"Las Golondrinas\" before he plants his own garden for the swallows to nest at during his vacation time. On Saint Joseph's Day, the children sing \"The Swallow Song\" together while they join Juan in the garden. Juan returns to his adobe house and observes the migration of the swallows who nested in his garden on a rose bush that appears near Mission San Juan Capistrano. They'll always come back to Mission San Juan Capistrano in the spring even though he gets to hear Julian sing the swallow song that the children also sang on Saint Joseph's Day.\n\nParagraph 9: He was born in Królówka near Bochnia. He came from the low nobility. He was a student at schools in Tarnów, where he also graduated from the grammar school. He served in the army of the Duchy of Warsaw. He took part in the campaign of 1812, during which he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. During the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig, he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Prussians. Having returned from captivity in 1814, he settled in Warsaw, where he worked as a clerk. He joined the freemasons, advanced to the fifth degree of initiation; in 1819 he became the secretary of the Great East. From 1818, he was a teacher of Polish literature and of style in schools of various degrees. He also co-operated with Pamiętnik Warszawski, initially as a member of the editorial staff and later as co-editor. In 1823 he became a member of the Society of the Friends of the Sciences. Having received his doctor's degree in philosophy, he was appointed Professor at Warsaw University. He travelled to Prague, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France. These journeys, made in order to improve his health, became an opportunity to make the acquaintance of Czech researchers into Slavic studies and Czech and Slovak folklore: Josef Jungmann, Václav Hanka and Ján Kollár. During the November Uprising, he was an editor of insurgent newspapers: Kurier Polski and Nowa Polska. Appointed a general inspector of schools by the insurgent authorities, he worked upon the reorganisation of education. After the collapse of the uprising he was dismissed from his posts. He stayed in Kraków for some time. In 1834 he returned to Warsaw, where he edited Jutrzenka and Magazyn Powszechny. In May 1835 he left for treatment to Carlsbad. On his way back he died in Dresden on 10 October 1835.\n\nParagraph 10: At White Bird Canyon, Brigadier General Oliver Howard, who outnumbered the Nez Perce two to one, was defeated on June 17, after firing on the Nez Perce who came to parley under a white flag. Thirty-four soldiers were killed, but only two Nez Perce warriors were. The Nez Perce who were now part of the group moving to Canada, numbered around 750, with only 200 warriors. Six weeks after leaving their homeland, U.S. Army forces performed a predawn attack on the 50 men, and 750 women and children encamped at Big Hole. The Nez Perce mounted a fierce resistance and managed to overwhelm the attacking force, cornering them on a hillside. Meanwhile, the women and children fled the battlefield after burying their dead. During the day and a half battle, the Nez Perce lost an estimated 60 to 90 men, women and children, although it is believed that actual losses may have been much higher with a good portion being women and children. U.S. forces lost 28 and an additional 40 serious casualties. The confrontation was the most violent battle between the Nez Perce and the U.S. Government forces. After the battle the Nez Perce fled east through Yellowstone National Park, then headed north. In October 1877, only  from the Canada–US border in Montana's Bear Paw Mountains, the starving and exhausted Nez Percé surrendered to the U.S. Forces commanded by General Oliver O. Howard, only after Howard and Miles said they would be allowed to return to their beloved Wallowas.  It was a lie. Approximately 150 Nez Perce warriors escaped to Canada prior to the surrender, leaving about 450 women, children and elderly.  Upon the final surrender by Chief Joseph he was quoted as saying, \"Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever\". The actual speech was much longer.\n\nParagraph 11: I met with a singular plant today in blume of which I preserved a specemine; it grows on the steep sides of the fertile hills near this place, the radix is fibrous, not much branched, annual, woody, white and nearly smooth. the stem is simple branching ascending, 2½ feet high celindric, villose and of a pale red colour. the branches are but few and those near its upper extremity. the extremities of the branches are flexible and are bent down near their extremities with the weight of the flowers. the leaf is sissile, scattered thinly, nearly linear tho' somewhat widest in the middle, two inches in length absolutely entire, villose, obtusely pointed and of an ordinary green. above each leaf a small short branch protrudes, supporting a tissue of four or five smaller leaves of the same appearance with those described. a leaf is placed underneath each branch, and each flower. the calyx is a one flowered spathe. the corolla superior consists of four pale purple petals which are tripartite, the central lobe largest and all terminate obtusely; they are inserted with a long and narrow claw on the top of the germ, are long, smooth, & deciduous. there are two distinct sets of stamens the 1st or principal consist of four, the filaments of which are capillary, erect, inserted on the top of the germ alternately with the petals, equal short, membranous; the anthers are also four each being elivated with its filament, they are linear and rather flat, erect sessile, cohering at the base, membranous, longitudinally furrowed, twice as long as the filament naked, and of a pale purple colour. the second set of stamens are very minute are also four and placed within and opposite to the petals, these are scarcely perceptible while the 1st are large and conspicuous; the filaments are capillary equal, very short, white and smooth. the anthers are four, oblong, beaked, erect, cohering at the base, membranous, shorter than the filaments, white naked and appear not to form pollen. there is one pistillum; the germ of which is also one, cilindric, villous, inferior, sessile, as long as the 1st stamens, and marked with 8 longitudinal furrows. the single style and stigma form a perfect monapetallous corolla only with this difference, that the style which elivates the stigma or limb is not a tube but solid tho' its outer appearance is that of the tube of a monopetallous corolla swelling as it ascends and gliding in such manner into the limb that it cannot be said where the style ends, or the stigma begins; jointly they are as long as the corolla, white, the limb is four cleft, saucer shaped, and the margins of the lobes entire and rounded. this has the appearance of a monopetallous flower growing from the center of a four petalled corollar, which is rendered more conspicuous in consequence of the 1st being white and the latter of a pale purple. I regret very much that the seed of this plant are not yet ripe and it is probable that it will not be so during my residence in this neighbourhood.\n\nParagraph 12: Hayward wrote singles for the Moody Blues including \"Nights in White Satin\", \"Tuesday Afternoon\", \"Voices in the Sky\", \"Never Comes the Day\", \"Question\", \"The Story in Your Eyes\", \"Driftwood\", \"The Voice\", \"Blue World\", \"Your Wildest Dreams\", \"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\" and \"English Sunset\"; in all, writing 20 of the group's 27 post-1967 singles. He also has a solo career. His first album outside the Moody Blues, Blue Jays, a collaboration with John Lodge, reached the UK top five in 1975. The single \"Blue Guitar\", recorded with 10cc as the backing band, reached the UK top ten in 1975, and his 1978 recording of \"Forever Autumn\" from Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds reached the UK top five.\n\nParagraph 13: Faran Thomason, who is best known as the producer of both Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales and Warlocked for the Game Boy Color, worked as a level designer and tester for the game. He stated that when the game was showcased in Atari Corp.'s US offices it was in a very basic state, consisting of only the ship flying and a rudimentary Gouraud-shaded terrain. The testing department at Atari was tasked to implement levels and structures in the game, while ATD laid down the terrain and enemies via a rudimentary editor the Atari testing team would use to implement them into the game. Cybermorph was first showcased at Atari's August 1993 press conference at Sunnyvale, California in an early but playable state. A 1993 promotional recording sent by Atari to video game retail stores features the game in a much earlier state with many differences compared to the final release. B.J. West, who worked as an animator in Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy, created both the cover art and ending sequence for the game. Sean Patter, producer of both Cybermorph and Iron Soldier, stated that by bringing the testing team to design game resulted in a lot of work but he remarked that by doing so resulted in making it into \"a much better game in the long run\". Several other members at Atari were also involved with its production.Cybermorph makes use of the various hardware features found within the Jaguar such as Z-buffering, which is used in multiple enemies of the game to various effects. In addition, Z-buffering is also used to handle drawing of all the objects and the planetary terrain. It also runs between 10-18 frames per second and displays around 6000 polygons on-screen. Gouraud shading is also used as a light source for all the polygon models, while the system's Motorola 68000 is used to move all of the objects in the game. The voice of Skylar was provided by Victoria Lowe, wife of video game composer David Lowe.Cybermorph was first released as the pack-in game for the Atari Jaguar when it launched on in North America on November 23, 1993. The game was later released in Europe on June 23, 1994, and finally in Japan as a stand-alone release on December 15 of the same year, where it was published by Mumin Corporation. Later versions of the game published in 1994 were stored on a one-megabyte cartridge and has several features missing from the original 1993 version such as the introduction and ending animation sequences, as well as additional voice samples. The cutting of these features in the one-megabyte version was a cost-effective measure Atari Corp. made in order to boost sales of the system, taking approximately two hours for the team to remove them in order to fit the game from a 2MB cart onto a 1MB cart. Fred Gill stated that \"whilst an interesting engineering exercise, it was painful ‘mutilating’ something that we'd crafted over such a long time\". It remained as a bundled title for the console. The game was included as part of the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One, marking its first re-release.\n\nParagraph 14: In a review for The Boston Phoenix, Michael Christopher speculated that the album would be received poorly by those who refuse to recognize the Misfits as legitimate without Glenn Danzig. \"The problem is, and has always been, that it just isn't the Misfits without Glenn Danzig at the helm\", he elaborated in the Delaware County Daily Times, \"[Only] retains the name in rights only, because there is no true legitimacy left within the group, which has featured a revolving door of backup players.\" \"That's a shame, because The Devil's Rain is chock full of good, campy horror business.\" He gave the album a mixed review in both publications, praising some tracks while criticizing others: Unexplained', 'Vivid Red', and 'Sleepwalkin' ' are fun and frightfully ferocious. Other points are stumbles: 'Monkey's Paw' has Only trying pitifully hard to ape the Misfits' 'Last Caress', and tracks like 'Curse of the Mummy's Hand' and 'Ghost of Frankenstein' are too predictable to be more than schlock, though it would be funny—in a good, goofy, send-up sort of way—if it was done under another moniker ... These guys just need another alias.\" Gentile expressed similar sentiments, complementing Only's bass and Cadena's guitar playing but saying that the group's choice to continue under the Misfits name seemed to limit their choice of subject matter: \"while the band has technical chops, it almost seems like they are singing about the occult and undead merely because that's what the Misfits are supposed to do. When original vocalist Glenn Danzig detailed 'the insemination of little girls in the middle of wet dreams', it seemed like that was something he was actually into. Even when second Misfits vocalist, Michael Graves, wailed that he was 'crying on a Saturday night', it seemed he was pulling from true early 20s dejection. But, when Only sings about mummies, or Frankenstein, or even hell, it doesn't seem like that's what he feels is important, but what he is limited to in subject matter, leaving the tunes without any sense of conviction.\" He did note that \"when the band does become most alive is when they play the style of music that excites them\", citing Only's doo-wop style in \"The Black Hole\" as an example. \"The Devil's Rain certainly isn't a disgrace\", he concluded, \"and long-running fans will find at least a few things to enjoy about the album. It's just frustrating that when the band snaps together and plays what they truly want to play, they aren't so much 'the Misfits' as a band containing a hefty amount of punk talent and experience. Instead of leaving the past behind, they seem to cling to it, forever condemning themselves to comparisons of previous incarnations.\" Lymangrover opined similarly, saying the album \"suffers from the fact that the group never tries to expand on the vocabulary established 30 years ago. If Famous Monsters was a step back for the Misfits legacy, this is a bigger step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nParagraph 15: Matanzas was one of the regions that saw intensive development of sugar plantations during the colonial era. Consequently, many African slaves were imported to support the sugar industry, particularly during the first half of the nineteenth century. For example, in 1792 there were 1900 slaves in Matanzas, roughly 30% of its population. In 1817, the slave population of Matanzas had grown to 10,773, comprising nearly 50% of the overall population. By 1841, 53,331 slaves made up 62.7% of the population of Matanzas. Census figures for 1859 put the Matanzas slave population at 104,519. Matanzas was the site of several slave insurrections and plots, including the infamous Escalera conspiracy (discovered in late 1843). Due to the high number of both slaves and, importantly, free Afro-Cubans in Matanzas, the retention of African traditions is especially strong there. In 1898, Matanzas became the location of the first action in the Spanish–American War. The city was bombarded by American Navy vessels on April 25, 1898, just after the beginning of the war.\n\nParagraph 16: Daniela Schwarz and colleagues, in 2007, concluded that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, which would have been connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines. A cover of either keratin or skin is indicated striations on the surface of the spines similar to those of bony horn cores of today's bovids. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling. Pablo Gallina and colleagues (2019) described the closely related Bajadasaurus, which had neural spines similar to those of Amargasaurus, and suggested that both genera employed them for defense. A defense function would have been especially effective in Bajadasaurus as the spines were directed forwards and would have reached past the tip of the snout, deterring predators. The keratinous sheath that likely covered the spines might have extended their length by 50%, as seen in some modern even-toed ungulates. Such extended sheaths would have made the delicate spines more resistant to damage—likely a critical threat, as the bases of the spines form the roof of the spinal chord.\n\nParagraph 17: Jones fondness for the duet stretched back to the beginning of his career when, in 1957, he recorded \"Yearning\", a hit with Jeanette Hicks.  He also recorded with Margie Singleton, Melba Montgomery, Brenda Carter and, most famously, Wynette.  The idea for My Very Special Guests was to pair Jones with his own country peers but also team him with admirers from other genres, an idea that was quite ahead of its time in the 1970s (Frank Sinatra would pretty much do the same thing with his Duets series years later).  The album featured many of the country stars that Jones fans were familiar with, like Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Paycheck (all three riding high on the red hot \"outlaw movement\") and Wynette, who sings \"It Sure Was Good\" with her ex, a song that nostalgically recalled the good times of a broken relationship (Ironically, the song was co-authored by George Richey, who Wynette married in the summer of 1978).  The ambitious pairings with pop and rock singers may have displeased many hardcore Jones fans but one of the songs, James Taylor's \"Bartender's Blues\", had been a top ten country hit in 1978.  Taylor wrote the tune with Jones in mind and sang harmony on the track.  Pop star Linda Ronstadt also joins Jones on the wistful \"I've Turned You To Stone\" and the pair would perform an impromptu version when she showed up at his 1980 performance at New York City's Bottom Line nightclub.  Emmylou Harris, who began her singing career backing country rock pioneer and Jones fan Gram Parsons, duets with Jones on the Rodney Crowell original \"Here We Are\" (Harris, who would go on to record with Jones several more times, had written the original liner notes for the singer's 1976 album The Battle, proclaiming that \"when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always\").  The Staples Singers and Dennis Locorriere and Ray Sawyer of the rock band Dr. Hook are also featured, but the most curious vocal pairing on My Very Special Guests came with then current New Wave star Elvis Costello.  Costello, an avowed Jones fan, had originally recorded the song for his debut album but it was left off due to the suggestion that including it might confuse the general public. \"When I was on the road back then, I used to have to hide my George Jones albums,\" Costello is quoted in the 2005 reissue of the album.  \"My manager used to say, 'Turn that George Jones off'...Jones was my guiding light whenever I wrote in a country idiom.\"\n\nParagraph 18: The storyline was furthered at Clash of the Champions XVII on November 19, 1991 in Savannah, Georgia. At the beginning of the Clash, which was televised live on TBS, WCW United States Heavyweight Champion (and perennial face) Sting was in the ring doing an interview. Madusa came out dressed as a harem girl and distracted Sting so WCW World Heavyweight Champion Lex Luger could attack him from behind by clipping his knee, the same one Sting injured in February 1990. Luger then bashed the knee against the runway repeatedly to make it seem like Sting had suffered severe damage. Several face wrestlers, including Bobby Eaton, ran out to run the heel Luger off and take Sting to the hospital. Sting, however, had to defend his title against Rude that night and did not want to leave. Eaton kept telling him he would have time, so he left. Bischoff rode in the ambulance with Sting and gave live updates on the condition of Sting from the hospital between matches to announcers Jim Ross and Tony Schiavone. Meanwhile, Dangerously had found a loophole in the match contract that specifically stated that if Sting was not able to defend his title, he would have to forfeit it to Rude. The announcers relayed the message to Bischoff, who in turn passed it along to Sting. Commotion could be heard in the background as Sting tried to leave the hospital and return to defend his title. It turned out that Eaton had been conspiring with Dangerously and Rude to ensure Sting did not make it out in time for his title defense.\n\nParagraph 19: In the summary of 1972, at the age of 21, he traveled to Greece and was transferred to AEK Athens, where he quickly established himself as a regular. He had the chance to be partnered alongside great players of the club, such as Mimis Papaioannou, Georgios Dedes, Walter Wagner, Thomas Mavros and Dušan Bajević in the offensive line, while as a penalty kick specialist, he was the player that took all the executions.  On 20 April 1975, in the derby against Panathinaikos, he was subbed on at the 92nd minute and a minute later he scored the winner with a penalty, in an episodic 4–3 at home. He scored his first international goals with AEK in the 3–1 win over Inter Bratislava, on 5 November 1975, scoring a brace within 2 minutes. On 12 May 1976, he scored at the home defeat for the Greek Cup. by 2–3 against Olympiacos from the spot after he just came in the match. On 29 September 1976 in Moscow, for the second leg of the First round of the UEFA Cup, the match was sent to overtime and in the final minute, AEK won a penalty with Konstantinou was to undertake the execution. The unruffled Tasos set up the ball on the spot and executed Gontar, sending AEK to the next round. There they came against Derby County and on 3 November 1976 he scored in the epic away 2–3 win of the \"yellow-blacks\". That season the team managed to reach to the semi-finals of the tournament. He was the scorer in one of the two goals of his team in the 2–0 win against Panathinaikos at home on 5 March 1978. On 17 May 1978 he also scored once against Olympiacos in the emphatic 6–1 victory for the semi-finals of the Cup. He was one of the key players in the largest victory of the club in the European Cup, with the imposig 6–1 over Porto scoring one of the goals. In the next round on 18 October 1978, he scored the only goal for his team in a 1–2 defeat at home against the Nottingham Forest of Brian Clough. He also scored in the Cup final against Panionios giving the lead to AEK from early on, however the club of Nea Smyrni turned the tie of the match and won by 3–1. During his 8-year presence at the club, he won two consecutive championships and a Cup, including a domestic double in 1978.\n\nParagraph 20: The scullery was a back kitchen located adjacent to the main kitchen, frequently to the rear of the house nearest the water supply, such as a public fountain or a well, or near a barrel that collected rain water, which was the preferred water for washing dishes. In houses built prior to indoor plumbing, scullery sinks were located against an outside wall. Since sculleries were used for washing and great quantities of water had to be carried inside, they were made with solid floors of brick, stone, terracotta tiles, or concrete. Although a drain, known as a soil pipe, would carry the dirty water outside of the house, the floors were likely to stay wet. The scullery maid, or person washing dishes at the sink, would stand on slatted wood mats near the sinks. The floor itself was often dug six inches or so (150mm) below the main house floor in case of leaks or flooding. In designing a scullery, architects would take care to place the room adjacent to the kitchen with a door leading directly outside to conveniently obtain water. However, for sanitation purposes (since so much slop was processed in the scullery) no doors led from there to the pantry or store rooms.\n\nParagraph 21: Captain Ben L. Salomon was serving at Saipan, in the Marianas Islands on July 7, 1944, as the Surgeon for the 2nd Battalion, 105th Infantry Regiment, 27th Infantry Division. The Regiment’s 1st and 2d Battalions were attacked by an overwhelming force estimated between 3,000 and 5,000 Japanese soldiers. It was one of the largest attacks attempted in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Although both units fought furiously, the enemy soon penetrated the Battalions’ combined perimeter and inflicted overwhelming casualties. In the first minutes of the attack, approximately 30 wounded soldiers walked, crawled, or were carried into Captain Salomon’s aid station, and the small tent soon filled with wounded men. As the perimeter began to be overrun, it became increasingly difficult for Captain Salomon to work on the wounded. He then saw a Japanese soldier bayoneting one of the wounded soldiers lying near the tent. Firing from a squatting position, Captain Salomon quickly killed the enemy soldier. Then, as he turned his attention back to the wounded, two more Japanese soldiers appeared in the front entrance of the tent. As these enemy soldiers were killed, four more crawled under the tent walls. Rushing them, Captain Salomon kicked the knife out of the hand of one, shot another, and bayoneted a third. Captain Salomon butted the fourth enemy soldier in the stomach and a wounded comrade then shot and killed the enemy soldier. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Captain Salomon ordered the wounded to make their way as best they could back to the regimental aid station, while he attempted to hold off the enemy until they were clear. Captain Salomon then grabbed a rifle from one of the wounded and rushed out of the tent. After four men were killed while manning a machine gun, Captain Salomon took control of it. When his body was later found, 98 dead enemy soldiers were piled in front of his position. Captain Salomon’s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nParagraph 22: The next advance in firearm design was the snaplock, which used flint striking steel to generate the spark.  The flint is held in a rotating, spring-loaded arm called the cock.  This is held cocked by a latch and released by a lever or trigger.  The steel is curved and hinged. This accommodates the arc of the flint, maintaining contact with the steel. The spark produced is directed downward into the flash pan. The snaphance incorporates a mechanism to slide the pan cover forward at the moment of firing.  The doglock incorporates a second latch (or dog) as a safety mechanism that engages the cock in a halfway or half-cock position.  The dog is independent of the trigger.  The dog is only released when the lock is bought to the full-cock position.  The  miquelet lock is the penultimate of the flint-sparking locks.  It has an \"L\" shaped frizzen, the base of which, covers the flash pan and is hinged forward of the pan.  The flint strikes against the upright of the \"L\" and flips the frizzen forward to reveal the pan to the sparks created.  The miquelet lock also has a half-cock mechanism similar in function but differing in operation from the doglock.\n\nParagraph 23: In a Syrian tale translated as Gomena, principe dei ginn (\"Gomena, Prince of the Djinni\"), a poor fisherman lives with his three daughters. After two unlucky fishing trips, he catches a large stone from the sea and, upon his third daughter's suggestion, places it as a makeshift door for their home. Later the same day, the third daughter meets a handsome stranger, they connect and she marries him. Despite a comfortable life, her husband only appears at night, so, after some convincing by some women in the hamman (bath house), she decides to come clean to him. The man tells her to get the stone, throw it back to the sea, and to wait for the sunrise. She obeys; her husband appears in the sea, slowly submerging. She insists to know his name, and shouts to him; he reveals his name is Gomena, and vanishes under the waves, and so her palaces and every treasure, save for her jewels on her. She sells her jewelry and opens a hammam, where everyone gets to bathe in exchange for a story. One night, a woman prepares to visit the hammam, but, since it is midnight and she is afraid of the ghouls, she climbs up a tree. She then sees three ginns appear, sing a song and announce the coming of Gomena; a table is set with a meal, Gomena appears and laments his lost love. The woman goes to the bath house and tells the girl about the scene. The girl goes to the place the woman described and waits until midnight for Gomena. He appears, sings verses of yearning and sorrow, and the girl appears to him, begging for his forgiveness. Gomena explains that his parents are the rulers of the ginns, and might kill her. After some insistence, Gomena takes his human wife on a magic carpet to his parents' palace. Before he enters, Gomena gives his wife an almond, a nut, and a pistachio nut for her to plant. However, the plants do grow overnight, but are stolen. Without food, she enters the ginns' service. One day, the queen of the ginns betrothes Gomena to a female ginn, and orders the girl to go to queen's sister, invite her for Gomena's wedding and get the box of the marching band. Gomena explains that this task is a trap: his aunt is a ghoul and will devour her, so he gives her two pieces of cow meat to throw to two ferocious dogs, and advises her to get the box and escape. The human girl follows the instructions and flees from the aunt's house. She opens the box on the way back and small creatures playing instruments escape from it. Gomena gets the creatures back into the box. Next, the queen of the ginns orders the human girl to go back to the aunt's house and get from her a ceremonial carpet. She gets the carpet (a small one) and unrolls it on the way back. Gomena appears to wrap it again, and concocts a plan with his human wife: she is to dance at the wedding, but she is to ask for two torches. The next day, during the wedding, the human girl dances with the torches, to the ginns' amazement. She then tosses one torch on the bride's lap, the other on the ginn assemblage, and escapes with Gomena on a winged horse.\n\nParagraph 24: Some of the Americans, led by Thompson, made their way out of the swamp to be confronted by HMS Martin, which drove them back into the swamp with grapeshot.  A column of men under Colonel Anthony Wayne fared only a little better, arriving out of the swamp only to face Fraser's formation. A brief exchange of fire took place: but the Americans, clearly outmatched by Fraser's forces, broke and ran, leaving arms and supplies behind. Portions of the American force retreated to the edge of the woods, which gave them some cover, and attempted to engage some of the British troops: but fire from those troops kept them off the road and fire from some of the ships in the river kept them from the shore.  St. Clair and a number of men made it back to the landing site, only to find it occupied by the British troops. Only by returning to the swampy woods and continuing to flee upriver did these men escape capture at that time.  Wayne eventually managed to form a rear guard of about 800 men, which attempted an attack on the British position; but they were driven back into the woods. Wayne then led a staggered retreat, in which companies of men slipped away, with the woods giving cover to hide their true numbers.\n\nParagraph 25: Euthecodon was a large-bodied crocodilian with an elongated snout similar to that of extant gavialoids. Euthecodon differs from any other known longirostrine crocodilian in its deeply scalloped rostral margins, each tooth sitting in its own bony sheath, separated from the next by a notable constriction of the rostrum, given the skull a saw-like appearance when viewed from above. The first mandibular teeth occlude outside of the premaxilla and never pierce it as seen in some other crocodilians. The individual teeth are slender, isodont and pointed with two keels (bicarinate), clearly suited for a piscivorous diet. Tooth count varies greatly between species. E. arambourgi, the species with the shortest snout, possesses 19 tooth sockets housing 20 teeth in the upper jaw.  Ginsburg and Buffetaut assign 24 upper jaw teeth to E. nitriae and up to 27 for E. brumpti. The largest specimen from Lothagam possesses 21 teeth in the upper jaw and 20 in the lower, while some specimens from the Pliocene to Pleistocene of Kenya (Koobi Fora) preserve 24 to 25 maxillary teeth opposing 21 to 22 dentary teeth. This difference in tooth count has led some researchers to question whether these specimens, typically assigned to E. brumpti, might actually represent their own species. Unlike any other crocodilians, Euthecodon typically possess only four premaxillary teeth instead of five, with Euthecodon arambourgi as an exception, seemingly representing a transitional form in the process of losing the tooth. While still possessing five premaxillary teeth, the second is notably smaller than the rest and shares a single sheath with the third premaxillary tooth. The nasal bone bears a prominent ridge leading up to the eyes, giving its forehead a sloping appearance somewhat similar to that of Crocodylus checchiai. This form is maintained until the contact between maxilla and premaxilla, where the snout slightly slopes upwards and places the nares on a pedestal. Both the forehead boss and raised nares are most prominent in E. brumpti and far less developed in either E. nitriae or E. arambourgi. The nasals are always excluded from any contact to the nares by the premaxilla reaching far back in between the maxilla, meeting the nasal bone at the level of the sixth maxillary tooth. The nasal is fused in some specimens, while others retain it as two distinct bones with visible sutures. Both the prefrontal bones and lacrimal bones are long and splinter-shaped, with the lacrimals contacting the nasal bones towards the middle or anterior end of the \"boss\" depending on the specimen. Notably, the skull table of Euthecodon is comparably small and almost square in shape, with oval supratemporal fenestra (not circular as in gavialoids). Older individuals are known to develop noticeable squamosal ridges or \"horns\".\n\nParagraph 26: Kenneth Malcolm Owen (born 23 April 1970) is an English drummer. He was born in Billinge and grew up in Gayton, Merseyside. He is best known as one of the founding members of extreme metal band Carcass, for which he also handled some of the vocals. After the band broke up in 1995, he started Blackstar, along with two other Carcass members. In February 1999, he suffered a brain haemorrhage at home and spent ten months in a hospital slowly emerging from a coma, making it impossible at the time for him to continue playing drums. More recently, he has started playing drums again, but mostly makes music using the computer software program Reason.\n\nParagraph 27: As initially built, the Flyer III looked almost the same as its predecessors, and offered equally marginal performance.  Orville suffered minor injuries in a serious nose-dive crash in the machine on July 14, 1905.  When rebuilding the airplane, the Wrights made important design changes that solved the stability problems of the earlier models.  They almost doubled the size of the elevator and rudder, and moved them about twice the distance from the wings.  They added two fixed half-moon shaped vertical vanes (called \"blinkers\") between the elevators (but later removed), and widened the skid-undercarriage which helped give the wings a very slight dihedral.  \n\nParagraph 28: Another primary feud from Raw was between Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon. On the December 26, 2005, edition of Raw, McMahon and Michaels had words ending with McMahon threatening that he could screw Michaels just like he did Bret Hart anytime he wanted. During the following couple of weeks on Raw, McMahon had inflicted some humiliation on Michaels. On the January 23 edition of Raw when it was between Michaels and Shelton Benjamin with McMahon declaring that if Michaels were to lose, he would also lose his spot in the Royal Rumble match. Michaels won the match and kept his spot in the Royal Rumble match but a few moments later, McMahon met Michaels backstage then stated that lady luck was on his side. He also said that he wanted to turn back the clock to the days of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll then he asked Michaels to join him but got turned down, however, and McMahon last stated that Michaels' luck would run out at the Royal Rumble. At the Royal Rumble, during the Royal Rumble match, McMahon distracted Michaels as his music started to play. During that time, Shane McMahon, who was not an official entrant in the match, eliminated Michaels after attacking him from behind. One month later, on the February 27 edition of Raw, Shane hit Michaels with a steel chair and forced him to \"kiss\" Vince's ass, thus joining Vince's \"Kiss My Ass Club.\" Vince then announced that he and Michaels would face off against each other at WrestleMania. On Raw two weeks later, Vince forced Michaels to take a public drug test all due to Michaels being deceived and drugged by Vince's daughter, Stephanie McMahon on the March 6 edition of Raw. During the test, however, Michaels threw his urine on both Vince and Shane. Later that night, Michaels faced off against the Spirit Squad in a Steel Cage match. The Spirit Squad won the match by pinning Michaels after Shane interfered and slammed the cage door on Michaels. After the match, Shane continued attacking Michaels, causing him to bleed in the process, and executed a Coast 2 Coast. At Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII, Michaels faced off against Shane in a Street Fight. Near the end of the match, Shane locked Michaels in the sharpshooter, and Vince ordered the match to end. Vince screwed Michaels, claiming he submitted to the move, and declared Shane the winner via submission. On the March 20 edition of Raw, Vince announced that his match against Michaels at WrestleMania would now be a No Holds Barred match.\n\nParagraph 29: Golubev was born and died in Moscow. He was taught by Nikolai Myaskovsky, and his students included Iosif Andriasov from 1958 till 1963, Alfred Schnittke, who studied with him from 1953 until 1958, Asya Sultanova, and Michael L. Geller. His own compositions included at least twenty-four string quartets, seven symphonies, three piano concertos - the last dedicated to and recorded by Tatiana Nikolayeva -, concertos for violin, cello and viola, ten piano sonatas (the sixth dedicated to Myaskovsky), sonatas for violin, cello and for trumpet (1956) (the latter dedicated to Sergei Nikolaevich Yeryomin), and quintets for strings with piano and with harp, among other works. This harp quintet is one of Golubev's few works that are still occasionally performed.\n\nParagraph 30: The Turian-Chay State Reserve was established for the protection and restoration of arid-arch light forest and other natural resources; and for the localization of centers of erosion at the foothills. The reserve is situated on the spurs of the Buz-Dag Ridge, in the southern foothills of the Major Caucasus, on the right bank of the River Turian-Chay in the Agdash area of the Republic. Its territory lies at a height of 400–650 m above sea level and extends for 35 km from east to west and for 5 km from north to south. The reserve is situated in an area of semi-desert and arid light forests, which mainly consist of pistachio, juniper, oak, having an important soil protecting, water protecting and climatic significance. In the relief of the reserve lowland mountains dominate with the peaks: Pirsei-Dag (609 m), Nulbon-Dag (437 m), Archan-Dag (476 m), Olmes-Dag (544 m) and others. As a rule they have steep, in some places denudated eroded slopes, and are separated by deep narrow valleys. The northern slopes are more gentle and covered with forests; the southern slopes are steep and strongly eroded. The general process of wind erosion has developed on the territory of the reserve. On the territory of the reserve 60 species of trees and bushes grow. The main types of sparsely growing trees are: Pistacia, fudian juniper (Juniper polucarpus), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxicedrus), Quercus iberica, ash-tree, Celtis caucasicus and pomegranate. Moreover, Populus, willow, alder, Elaeagnus and other trees also grow in this area. Two dendraflora species of the reserve – Juniperus and pomegranate are included in the Red Book. There are 24 species of mammals and 112 species of birds, 20 species of reptiles and 3 species of amphibians in the reserve. Among the birds there are partridge (Alectoris kakelik), pigeons, Cercheneis tinnunculus, griffon (Gyps fulvus), black vulture (Aegypius monachus) and others. Among mammals there are wild boar, brown bear, badger, stone marten, lynx, jackal, European wild cat, hare and others. Among reptiles there are amongst others Macrovipera lebetina. Along the former river- beds and channels the Caspian turtle can be found, and on the slopes of the mountain the spur-thighed tortoise can be observed, which, as well as the Coluber caucasicus (?), is included in the Red Book. The main protected objects are the model natural complexes of the Boz-Dag Ridge with the developed pistachio-arch light forests, area of semi-desert, arid and tugay vegetation. The state of arid light forest on the Boz-Dag are of great concern primary primarily because in spite of the productivity of the majority of tree species, including juniper, the regeneration of these forests in general is very slow. The establishment of the Turian-Chay reserve brought -an improvement in the situation with the regeneration of these forests. During the 40 years of the reserve's existence the pistachio-juniper light forest has extended its area and the general quality of trees has increased. The replacement of juniper by pistachio has almost stopped. Shrubbery and herbage lave also developed well, considerably reducing the process of soil erosion.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text describes the anatomical features of Euthecodon, a large crocodilian species with an elongated snout. It is noted that Euthecodon has unique characteristics, such as deeply scalloped rostral margins and teeth sitting in separate bony sheaths with a saw-like appearance. The species has slender, pointed teeth with two keels, indicating a piscivorous diet. The tooth count varies between species, leading some researchers to question whether they represent different species. Euthecodon typically has four premaxillary teeth, except for Euthecodon arambourgi, which has five teeth with the second one smaller. The forehead boss and raised nares are most prominent in E. brumpti and less developed in E. nitriae or E. arambourgi. The nasal bone is excluded from contact with the nares, and the skull table is small and square-shaped. Older individuals may develop squamosal ridges or \"horns\".\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

He goes behind her and sedates her with nitrous oxide. She finds herself duct taped to the dental chair and cries and begs him to let her go. He puts a mouth clamp in her mouth to keep it open and drills her bottom-right molar tooth to the raw nerve as a \"lie detector\" to find out who else she has told. If she lied, he would take a sharp plaque scraping hook and painfully force it into the nerve of the tooth he drilled, wiggling the tooth hard at the same time. He repeatedly jams the hook into the exposed nerve causing Beverly tremendous pain. Robbie comes to install some more drywall and rings the office door bell, leaving Alan no choice but to pause his torture session and answer the door. Robbie asks to come in and after Beverley screams Robbie goes rushing to check on her. Just as Robbie is about to rescue her, Feinstone attacks him from outside the doorway. In the ensuing fight, Alan kills Robbie with a hammer, turns back to Beverley and re-tapes her to the dental chair. He takes a pair of dental pliers and plays a game of \"truth or tooth\". He asks her what did she tell Jeremy about Washington but he doesn't believe her then pulls out her left front tooth, then he asks her what she did tell Jamie. He then attempts to pull her left incisor tooth out, but instead he breaks it by accident which angers Feinstone even more. Alan then painfully drills one of her bottom front teeth down to the nerve, and continues to drill so hard that the dental clamp holding her mouth slips out from the pressure he's applying. Then, out of a final act of desperation and what seems to be her only defense, she bites down hard on the drill causing it to lock up and jam inside her teeth. Infuriated, the mad dentist tells her he has a much better idea, and that he will cut the drill out of her mouth. She then screams, and the scene comes to a close.\n\nParagraph 2: After the disqualification to Renda, on 8 March, Booth's return came in a narrow points-loss to former British super welterweight champion Prince Arron, to which referee Phil Edwards scored 57–58 at the Bowlers Exhibition Centre in Manchester. After his narrow points loss to Arron, Booth secured himself a 17 May shot for the vacant English light-middleweight title against Navid Mansouri (11-1-1) at Ponds Forge Arena in Sheffield. Originally, Mansouri was scheduled to face Nathan Graham (14-5-1), however, that encounter was postponed due to an injury suffered by Graham, to which Booth stepped in at late notice as a replacement. Mansouri charged, but Booth was unfazed, using his jab and moving nicely. Booth did open up but Mansouri was very impressive in evading the shots. Just before the end of the first, Booth had success with a right hand which made Mansouri wince, with him returning to his corner in discomfort and concerned about his left eye. Booth obviously felt in control in the second-round; Booth did less than Mansouri but his work was more effective; Mansouri charged at Booth with mixed results. Mansouri rushed at Booth early in the third but found himself tied up. Much of the work was done at close quarters in this session and it was difficult to judge who had the upper hand. In the fourth, Booth offered some crisp work but spent time admiring his successes whilst the less-refined Mansouri chugged along. In the fifth, Mansouri landed some scoring punches early in the session, especially to the body, and Booth was much less comfortable having to put pressure on rather than react to it. Round six was another close round with both fighters beginning to look tired. Booth opened up with determination to start the seventh, and Mansouri boxed off the back foot again. Mansouri was still scoring sporadically to the body, though Booth was hunting him down but not taking full advantage of the positions he was getting himself into, throwing ones and twos rather than sustained combinations. Booth cracked in a hard right early in the eighth but rather than pouncing on Mansouri he took his time which might not have been the best strategy given that Mansouri did look a little tired. Mansouri's courage had shown as Booth asked him a question in the ninth, with the Rotherham man coming back with a nice right hand; Booth was invariably on the front foot but he just couldn't nail Mansouri down. Booth landed a nice left hook to begin the final round. Booth charged but Mansouri stopped him with a counter right hook. A left hook to the body landed from Booth but Mansouri characteristically gritted his teeth and fired back. Referee Terry O’Connor had to split the tiring pair several times as their admirable efforts became more scrappy. Booth landed a hard overhand right but the final bell came before he could seek any advantage from it. After ten entertaining rounds of boxing, judges Steve Gray, Mark Lyson, and Dave Parris scored the bout 94–98, 94–98, and 94–96 all in favour for Mansouri, who improved his spotless record to 12-1-1.\n\nParagraph 3: On the final weekend before the election, the Sudbury Star published an article headlined, \"City misled public about manager's dismissal,\" alleging that Rodriguez and the incumbent council had deliberately lied to the public about the resignation of Alan Stephen, the former manager of the city's infrastructure and emergency services division, in 2006. The incident described in the article was one in which the city appeared to simply have followed its legal obligation to maintain confidentiality around matters involving employee relations. Still, the article disclosed that Stephen promoted friends within his department, locked the city into 10-year contracts that cost the city up to $1.2 million annually, and took a leadership role at the site of an incident in which he was not qualified to do so, promoting a Ministry of Labour investigation into whether firefighters' lives were put at risk. The newspaper subsequently faced criticism for its portrayal of the story and for publishing the story only after it would be too late for Rodriguez or any other member of the city's staff to respond ahead of election day; in an interview on CBC Northern Ontario's Points North following the election, Sudbury Star managing editor Brian MacLeod pointed out that Rodriguez had several days to respond, but offered no comment on the story. He stated that the paper had received the information in an anonymous brown envelope several days before the story went to print. The Ontario Provincial Police subsequently announced that they were conducting an investigation into the leak.\n\nParagraph 4: Nigel d'Aubigny was son of Roger d'Aubigny (of Saint-Martin-d'Aubigny) and with his brother William was an ardent supporter of Henry I. The brothers were rewarded with great estates in England. William was made king's butler, and was father of William d'Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel; Nigel was rewarded with marriage to the former the wife of the imprisoned Robert de Mowbray, and with the escheated Norman fief of her former husband, also being give a number of lands in England.  After a decade of childless marriage, he would divorce Matilda and remarry in 1118 to Gundred de Gournay (died 1155), daughter of Gerard de Gournay, lord of Gournay.  They had one son by that marriage, Roger, who would inherit from his father the Mowbray lands in Normandy and take the Mowbray surname.Roger, a great lord with a hundred knight's fees, was captured with King Stephen at the battle of Lincoln, joined the rebellion against Henry II (1173), founded abbeys, and went on crusade. His grandson William, a leader in the rising against King John, was one of the 25 barons of the Magna Carta, as was his brother Roger, and was captured fighting against Henry III at the rout of Lincoln (1217).\n\nParagraph 5: In 2005, Buehrle began the season with a 10–3 record, a 2.58 ERA and a 1.11 WHIP. On April 16, he finished a game against the Seattle Mariners in only 1 hour and 39 minutes, giving up only one run and three hits (all to Ichiro Suzuki), and backed by only two White Sox runs, both homers by Paul Konerko. In the game, he threw just 106 pitches. Subtracting the time spent between innings, the game took only  minutes to play. Buehrle was selected to the American League All-Star Team, and was named the starting pitcher after Roy Halladay could not to play due to a broken leg. He pitched two innings, allowing no runs and striking out three batters while earning a win. Buehrle's streak of 49 consecutive starts of six or more innings ended on August 1, 2005, after he was ejected for hitting Baltimore Orioles outfielder B. J. Surhoff. During the White Sox playoff run, Buehrle pitched a complete game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in Game 2 of the ALCS, the first of four consecutive complete games for White Sox starters. On October 25, 2005, Buehrle became the first pitcher in World Series history to start and save consecutive games, earning a no-decision in Game 2 and his first career save in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series, which the Sox swept from the Houston Astros, winning their first world championship since 1917.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1952, Kuroya and his colleagues attempted to identify an infectious agent in human tissue samples at Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan. The samples were taken from the lung of a newborn child that was affected by fatal pneumonia. The primary isolate from the samples was passaged in mice and subsequently in embryonated eggs.  The isolated infectious agent was later called Sendai virus, which was used interchangeably with the name “Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan”. Kuroya and his colleagues were convinced that they isolated the virus, which is a new etiological agent for human respiratory infections. Later in 1954, Fukumi and his colleagues at the Japan National Institute of Health put forward an alternative explanation for the origin of the virus. It was suggested that the mice used to passage the virus were infected with the mouse virus. Thus, mouse virus was later transferred to embryonated eggs, isolated and finally named the Sendai virus. This explanation of Fukumi, pointing to the mouse rather than the human origin of the virus, has been supported by numerous scientific data later. The historical aspects of the Sendai virus isolation and controversy behind it are well described in the review. Thus, for some time, it was erroneously assumed that Sendai virus is human disease causing pathogen. The incorrect assumption that the virus was isolated from human infectious material is still reported by Encyclopædia Britannica and by ATCC in the description of the history of the viral isolate Sendai/52. It was also believed that the virus could cause disease not only in humans but also in pigs, because antibodies to the virus were often found in their organisms during the swine epidemic in Japan in 1953–1956. High incidence of seropositivity to the virus was observed in pigs in 15 districts of Japan.  An explanation was later found for this widespread detection of antibodies (see the section below). Yet, despite overwhelming evidence that indicate that SeV is host restrictive rodent pathogen, in some veterinary manuals. and safety leaflets, SeV is still listed as a virus that can cause disease in pigs. Similar information is provided by Encyclopædia Britannica. In reality, the multiple isolates of paramyxoviruses in pigs, using modern nucleic acid sequencing methods, have never been identified as SeV.\n\nParagraph 7: In April 1995, there was a celebration conference and performance in his honor called \"Fiedlerfest\" at the Center for the Arts at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Several famous writers such as Allen Ginsberg, Camille Paglia and Ishmael Reed paid homage to him and his works. Although some sources wrongly attribute different dates, the series of conferences took place at the Center for the Arts at the University of Buffalo from April 29 through April 30, 1995.  Considered one of the most influential figures in 20th century American cultural thought, Fiedler is the author of over 40 works, some of which have been used in many courses in American universities. The conference originated from an idea that Fiedler's friend and colleague Bruce Jackson had in 1994. The idea was that the University of Buffalo should do something to celebrate their best-known professor and literary critic while he was still alive. They asked Fiedler to name the key speakers of the conference and he selected three people he admired: Camille Paglia, Allen Ginsberg, and Ishmael Reed. The university funded the event, which also had the participation of a master Daejaeng player related to one of the Korean students in the English Department, who played in Fiedler's honor. The art theorist, feminist academic and critic Camille Paglia performed on Saturday night. On Sunday afternoon, at 4 pm, it was the turn of beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg to perform. Ginsberg was an old friend of Fiedler's and had written the poem \"Uptown\" about Fiedler's children after their arrival in New York, coming from Missoula, MT to start a band. He read his poems while playing a small hand-pumped harmonium from India. He was later followed by the Daejaeng performance. American poet, songwriter, novelist, playwright and essayist Ishmael Reed was the last to perform. The celebration culminated with a reception in the Center for the Arts Atrium at UB.  \n\nParagraph 8: The company started overnight operations on April 17, 1973, with fourteen Dassault Falcon 20s that connected twenty-five cities in the United States. Fred Smith's childhood friend, John Fry of Ardent Studios, sent Ardent partner Terry Manning to the Federal Express home office on Democrat Road near the Memphis Airport with the first package to be put into the system. That night, 186 packages were carried. Services included both overnight and two-day package and envelope delivery services, as well as Courier Pak. Federal Express began to market itself as \"the freight service company with 550-mile-per-hour delivery trucks\". However, the company began to experience financial difficulties, losing up to a million USD a month. While waiting for a flight home to Memphis from Chicago after being turned down for capital by General Dynamics, Smith impulsively hopped a flight to Las Vegas, where he won $27,000 playing blackjack. The winnings enabled the cash-strapped company to meet payroll the following Monday. \"The $27,000 wasn't decisive, but it was an omen that things would get better\", Smith says. In the end, he raised somewhere between $50 and $70 million, from twenty of the US's leading risk venture speculators, including such companies as the First National City Bank of New York and the Bank of America in California. At the time, Federal Express was the most highly financed new company in U.S. history, in terms of venture capital.\n\nParagraph 9:  11 February Running to Time, about the new InterCity 225; the National Express Coaches Rapide service; the project team of the Intercity 225, with project director Mike Rollin, and Mike Newman of GEC; the 225 train had to be delivered on 14 February 1988, with an operational life of thirty years; the InterCity 125 was not intended to have been primarily developed - in a board meeting, the commercial directors were not technologically knowledgeable of trains, and asked about alternatives, to be told by an engineering director that a 125mph diesel train could be developed in two years, so the HST began at that meeting; the British Rail APT-E prototype, powered by the Leyland 2S/350 gas turbine; in 1974 BR commissioned the APT-P, which had ten years of development, due to the active tilting suspension; the 225 train was possibly to enter service on the UK's only large electrified line, the West Coast Main Line, but the much-straighter and faster East Coast Main Line was being electrified, so BR decided to implement the 225 train on the ECML instead; Crewe railway station, which opened in 1837, and where trains were first built nearby in 1843; Steve Corfield, of Crewe Works; the unsprung mass of a train, and Cardan shafts; Roger Ford (journalist) of Modern Railways; John Prideaux, director of InterCity; David Carter of DCA in Warwick, who designed the livery; the Modernisation Plan was published in December 1954, which had advocated the electrification of the ECML, and the phasing-out of steam travel; the late-1980s ECML electrification had cost BR £350m - it was not government-funded, with 2,800 miles of copper wire, and 33,000 support masts, overseen by Don Heath; all of the improvements in the UK were on old lines of track, but France and Germany had built entire new electrified lines - the TGV was planned from the mid-1960s; G. Freeman Allen of Jane's World Railways; the 225 train underframe being built at Crewe Works; GEC Traction at Preston, Lancashire, Al Reed, the separately-excited (Armature Controlled DC Motor) brushed DC electric motor, and Gerald West; the right-angle gearboxes were built by David Brown Ltd and Voith of Heidenheim an der Brenz in southern Germany; Eric Black of Metro-Cammell in Washwood Heath; the ST41 bogies were made by SIG Combibloc Group of Neuhausen am Rheinfall in Switzerland. Narrated by Robin Ellis, produced by Patrick Uden, directed by Paul Fabricius, made by Uden Associates.\n\nParagraph 10: The German positions facing X Corps were of great strength: Thiepval itself formed a strongpoint on the crest of a ridge overlooking the British lines, while other strongpoints protected the German line with crossfire. The main bombardment was to extend over five days, U, V, W, X and Y, before the assault was launched on Z Day. The strenuous work of firing the heavy guns and howitzers was divided into 2-hour periods to allow the gunners to rest, Forward Observation Officers (FOOs) to be relieved, and the guns to cool. U Day was 24 June, but on several days the weather was too bad for good air or ground observation and the programme was extended by two days (Y1 and Y2). During the bombardment 76th Siege Bty concentrated on strongpoints and machine gun posts in and around Thiepval, including the chateau and Mouquet Farm ('Mucky Farm'). From X Day the intensity of the bombardment increased, with A and B guns firing 130 rounds each in 12 hours, and C and D 125 rounds each in 6 hours (the 9.2-inch howitzer was only designed to fire 6 rounds per hour). On Z Day (1 July, the First day on the Somme) the artillery programme began at 06.35. The infantry went 'over the top' at 07.30 and the heavy artillery bombardment proceeded through its planned phases, lifting from one objective to the next. However, in the words of 25th HAG's war diary, the attack was 'not very successful: Left Division (36th) gained objective, 32nd Division held up'. One brigade of 36th (Ulster) Division had swept through the German positions opposite, but the other was shot down in No man's land. 32nd Division had crept into No man's land under cover of the barrage and the men rushed the German front trenches, but were then cut down crossing the open ground. At 08.30 the 4th Phase bombardment was ordered to be repeated because the infantry were held up in front of Thiepval and could not reach their objective. The batteries continued firing on this line until 10.55 (incidentally blocking the planned advance of 36th (Ulster) Division's reserve brigade), when 76th Siege Bty was ordered to cease fire and the other batteries switched to shelling German strongpoints. 76th Siege Bty joined in a re-bombardment of the trenches at 12.15 and then a bombardment of Thiepval from 15.00, but it was too scattered to be effective and the advance could not be restarted, while counter-attacks drove the Ulstermen out of most of their gains.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 299–300, 304–5, 394–421.Farrar-Hockley, pp. 124–6, 130–8.Penstone, pp. 20–2.\n\nParagraph 11: Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends received generally positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the album has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated, \"They demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album – it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X&Y and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head – that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying.\" Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly magazine rated the album \"A−\" and called it their best album, while Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, wrote a mixed review, explaining: \"Viva la Vidas mild tinkering with the formula represents a failure of imagination: perhaps it's hard to think outside the box when the box is the size of the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena. Equally, however, there's a genuine conviction about its contents, a huge advance both on its predecessor and their legion of imitators.\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that \"Coldplay's desire to unite fans around the world with an entertainment they can all relate to is the band's strength, and a worthy goal. But on Viva la Vida, a record that wants to make strong statements, it's also a weakness. Sometimes, to say what needs to be said, you need to risk pissing people off.\" Melodic magazine's critic Kaj Roth gave the album 4/5 and felt that \"the typical Coldplay trademark is there too with beautiful atmospheric melodies that will embrace the heart\". Spin magazine's critic Mikael Wood said in a positive review of the album, \"For all of Coldplay's experimentation, though, there's no doubting that Viva la Vida, with its sturdy melodies and universal themes – think love, war and peace – is an album meant to connect with the masses (arenas have been built for less than the climax of \"Death and All His Friends\"). The band's triumph lies in how exciting they make that prospect seem\". IGN gave the album 9.3/10, while Q said: \"So some habits die hard, but on every other level Viva La Vida [...] is an emphatic success [...], radical in its own measured way but easy to embrace\". Robert Christgau gave it a one-star honorable mention (), saying: \"Applying all his powers, Chris Martin successfully dilutes Radiohead, with — what else? Pleasant results\".\n\nParagraph 12: Landon was private secretary to the Governor of New South Wales William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, 1900. In 1898 he and Beauchamp had holidayed in Paris. In 1903 he was special correspondent of the Daily Mail at the Delhi Durbar, in China, in Japan and in Siberia; in 1903–1904 he was special correspondent of The Times on the British military expedition to Lhasa, Tibet; in 1905–1906 he was special correspondent of The Times for the Prince of Wales' visit to India; and after that he was in Persia, India, and Nepal, 1908; Russian Turkestan 1909; Egypt and Sudan 1910; on the North Eastern Frontier of India and at the Delhi Durbar, 1911; in Mesopotamia and Syria, 1912; in Scandinavia and behind the British and French lines in 1914–1915; behind the Italian lines and to the Vatican in 1917 (the war and Vatican visits with Kipling); at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919; in Constantinople, 1920; in India, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine 1921; on the Prince of Wales' tour of India and Japan, 1921–1922; in China and North America 1922; at the Peace Conference in Lausanne, 1923; in China, Nepal and Egypt 1924; and in China in 1925 (source except where noted: Who Was Who).\n\nParagraph 13: The Asian PGA was formed in July 1994 at a meeting in Hong Kong attended by PGA representatives from eight countries. The first season of the APGA Omega Tour, as it was known for sponsorship reasons, was played in 1995 and within a few years it had supplanted the existing tour in the region, the Asia Golf Circuit that was run by the Asia Pacific Golf Confederation, as the leading golf tour in Asia outside of Japan. In 1998 the Asian Tour became the sixth member of the International Federation of PGA Tours. Under a new sponsorship deal, between 1999 and 2003 the tour was known as the Davidoff Tour, before adopting its current name in 2004.\n\nParagraph 14: Various sources mention its use by some Native Americans people to elect a new leader. This story appears to originate from an anecdote told by John Josselyn in his 1674 “ An Account of Two Voyages to New-England”. It is noteworthy that Josselyn's \"Account of Two Voyages\" have been met with skepticism since their first publication.“The English in New-England take white Hellebore, which operates as fairly with them, as with the Indians, who steeping of it in water sometime, give it to young lads gathered together a purpose to drink, if it come up they force them to drink again their vomit, (which they save in a Birchen-dish) till it stayes with them, & he that gets the victory of it is made Captain of the other lads for that year.“   The anecdote entered medical literature 161 years afterward, when retold by Osgood C. in an 1835 paper on Veratrum viride. While quoting Josselyn, Osgood introduces a political connotation (election of their chiefs/entitled to command the rest) which is unclear in the original version. \" Its use in the election of their chiefs, is noticed by Joselin, an early visiter to this country, who calls it “ white hellebore.” According to this writer, that individual whose on the Veratrum Viride. stomach was least susceptible to its deleterious effects, was regarded as the “ strongest of the party, and entitled to command the rest.”\n\nParagraph 15: In a February 2022 court motion related to Sussmann's prosecution, Durham alleged that Sussmann associate Rodney Joffe and his associates had \"exploited\" capabilities his company had through a pending cybersecurity contract with the Executive Office of the President (EOP) to acquire nonpublic government Domain Name System (DNS) and other data traffic \"for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump.\" Joffe was not charged and his attorney did not immediately comment. After Sussmann's September 2021 indictment, The New York Times reported that in addition to analyzing suspicious communications involving a Trump server, Sussmann and analysts he worked with became aware of data from a YotaPhone — a Russian-made smartphone rarely used in the United States — that had accessed networks serving the White House, Trump Tower and a Michigan hospital company, Spectrum Health. Like the Alfa-Bank server, a Spectrum Health server also communicated with the Trump Organization server. Sussmann notified CIA counterintelligence of the findings in February 2017, but it was not known if they were investigated. Durham alleged in his February 2022 court motion that Sussmann had claimed his information \"demonstrated that Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations,\" but Durham said he found no evidence to support that. Sussmann's attorneys  responded that Durham knew Sussman had not made such a claim to the CIA. Durham alleged Sussmann's data showed a Russian phone provider connection involving the EOP \"during the Obama administration and years before Trump took office.\" Attorneys for an analyst who examined the YotaPhone data said researchers were investigating malware in the White House; a spokesman for Joffe said his client had lawful access under a contract to analyze White House DNS data for potential security threats. The spokesman asserted Joffe's work was in response to hacks of the EOP in 2015 and of the DNC in 2016, as well as YotaPhone queries in proximity to the EOP and the Trump campaign, that raised \"serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election\" that was shared with the CIA. Durham asserted that Sussmann bringing his information to the CIA was part of a broader effort to raise the intelligence community's suspicions of Trump's connections to Russia shortly after he took office. Durham did not allege that any eavesdropping of Trump communications content occurred, nor did he assert the Clinton campaign was involved or that the alleged DNS monitoring activity was unlawful or occurred after Trump took office.\n\nParagraph 16: But no sooner was Luther dead than did the internal, as well as the external, peace of the Lutheran Church decline. It was a misfortune not only for Melanchthon but for the whole Lutheran body, that he who had formerly stood as a teacher by the side Luther, the original leader, was now forced suddenly into the position to head not only the University of Wittenberg but the entire Evangelical Church of Germany. There was among Luther's associates, notably Nikolaus von Amsdorf, a disinclination to accept Melanchthon's leadership. When, in the negotiations between German Protestants and Catholics that resulted in the Augsburg Interim and Leipzig Interim, Melanchthon showed himself ready to yield and make concessions on matters adiaphora, he ruined his position with a large part of the Evangelical theologians. An opposition party was formed in which the leadership was assumed by Flacius in view of his learning, controversial ability, and inflexible firmness. Melanchthon, on the other hand, with his faithful followers Joachim Camerarius, Georg Major, Justus Menius, Johann Pfeffinger, Paul Eber, Caspar Cruciger the Elder, Victorinus Strigel, and others saw in the self-styled genuine Lutherans nothing but a narrow and contentious class, which, ignoring the inherent teaching of Luther, sought to domineer over the church by letter and name, and in addition to assert its own ambitious self. On the other hand, the Philippists regarded themselves as the faithful guardians of learning over against the alleged \"barbarism,\" and as the mean between the extremes. The genuine Lutherans also claimed to be representatives of the pure doctrine, defenders of orthodoxy, and heirs of the spirit of Martin Luther. Personal, political, and ecclesiastical animosities widened the breach; such as the rivalry between the Ernestine branch of the Saxon house (now extruded from the electoral dignity) and the Albertine branch; the jealousy between the new Ernestine University of Jena and the electoral universities of Wittenberg and Leipzig, in both of which the Philippists had the majority; and the bitter personal antagonism felt at Wittenberg for Flacius, who assailed his former teachers harshly and made all reconciliation impossible.\n\nParagraph 17: The tour took an intimate and organic approach, focusing on Jackson's musicality and showmanship in dedication to her fans. Each segment focuses on a different theme based on the song's lyrical content. The show began with a video introduction of Jackson explaining its concept. After this, a music video of the individual song dedicated to the current city is shown. She enters from the back of the audience flaunting a \"scythe-edged\" haircut in a grey catsuit to perform opening number \"The Pleasure Principle\", moving throughout the venue's centerpiece while interacting with the crowd. Upon reaching the stage, she performed \"Control\", \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\", and \"Feedback\" before transitioning to \"You Want This\" and \"Alright\", replicating each song's signature dance moves. A film reel of highlights from Jackson's acting career was played during a brief interlude, including scenes from Good Times, Poetic Justice, The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, and Why Did I Get Married Too?. She reappeared in a diamond-encrusted lavender gown and sat on a stool in center stage to perform several unplugged ballads. The set began with \"Nothing\" and \"Come Back to Me\" before closing with \"Let's Wait Awhile\" and \"Again\", briefly pausing to allow the audience to sing several verses in their entirety. \"Janet's Image\", a second video montage consisting of Jackson's most iconic photographs is shown before she returned in a sleeveless black vest. The third set focused on upbeat love songs, beginning with \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and leading into \"Love Will Never Do (Without You)\", \"When I Think of You\", and \"All for You.\" After a slight pause, she sang \"That's the Way Love Goes.\" The band played an instrumental version of \"What About\" during a costume break. Upon emerging, Jackson segued through a rock-influenced portion in a black jacket, performing \"Black Cat\" and \"If\", emulating its music video's iconic choreography. The set closed with \"Scream\" and \"Rhythm Nation.\" Following a final intermission, Jackson and her dancers reappeared in matching white outfits for the show's encore. Her then-most recent number one hit \"Make Me\" lead the set. followed by the show's finale, \"Together Again.\" Throughout the song, childhood images of her with Michael Jackson appeared on screens in tribute to his death. The show ended with Jackson speaking to the crowd and waving goodbye as she exits the stage. \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\", \"Runaway\", \"Call on Me\", \"I Get Lonely\", \"Diamonds\", \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\", \"Throb\", \"Go Deep\" and \"When We Oooo\" were performed on selected dates.\n\nParagraph 18: On 10 June, massive news was announced at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. Rumours of the club's ownership being taken-over by Azerbaijani businessman Hafiz Mammadov was confirmed. This saw the ownership of the club pass from Chairman Milan Mandarić, who had owned the club since 2010, in which he saved the club from administration, cleared the club from the majority of its debts, invested into the team to gain promotion to the Football League Championship in the 2011–12 season and has since stabilised the club in the Championship. Milan Mandarić can be classed as a legend at the club, due to saving the Owls from potential extinction and climbing the English football league ladder. Milan Mandarić had this to say: \"I am delighted to have concluded a deal with Hafiz, he is a true football man and I have no doubt whatsoever that I am handing over control to someone with a real passion for the game and the ability to carry on the work I started three years ago to return Sheffield Wednesday back to the top division of English football. It's something that the wonderful supporters of this Club deserve having remained so loyal throughout the difficult times prior to my arrival. On my first day at the Club I promised the supporters two things; firstly I would ensure that when I left we would be in far better shape than when I arrived and more importantly, that I would only hand over ownership when I found the right man for the Club and I sincerely believe I have delivered on both undertakings\". Meanwhile, Hafiz Mammadov is a successful businessman whom owns Baghlan Group (a company that specialises in oil, gas, construction and transportation), and also owns Azerbaijan football club Baku FC and French team RC Lens, along with having shares in La Liga champions Atlético Madrid and F.C. Porto. Mammadov is known to have a quieter, more private approach with his work and is thought to have bought the club for around €50 million. Hafiz Mammadov had this to say: \"I am a passionate football fan with enormous respect for English football. I have been looking at investing in England for some time but I was determined to find the right Club. I am hugely ambitious and feel the Owls match my passion and desire for success and represent our motto of Azerbaijan Land of Fire. I promise the supporters I will work extremely hard to bring the success everyone so rightly craves.\" On 9 July, rumours occurred across the internet that Sheffield Wednesday owner to be, Hafiz Mammadov, had been arrested by police in his home country of Azerbaijan. Mammadov is still yet to have clarified and confirmed the takeover with the Football League and has still yet to make payments to the French football league on behalf of his other ownership of RC Lens. Lens have had their promotion to Ligue 1 suspended because of this. However, just after 5pm that day and Hafiz Mammadov released a statement saying: \"Certain unfounded rumours have been spread in the press over my supposed arrest and imprisonment in Azerbaijan, which I obviously strongly deny, and which was immediately denied by State Border Guards. It seems today that false and malicious speculation over my situation is being used with the aim to create confusion and doubt over my financial holdings and commitments. There are no grounds for the allegations made by the press, and I will take all necessary legal actions against whoever has initiated these false rumours with the aim to harm my family and me\". This statement would have been of grate relief to the fans of Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nParagraph 19: In 1903, a controversy arose that would eventually lead to a significant event in the evolution of academic freedom in U.S. higher education.  This series of events is known as the \"Bassett Affair.\"  Popular professor John Spencer Bassett published an article in the South Atlantic Quarterly entitled \"Stirring Up the Fires of Race Antipathy\" in October 1903.  In the article, he spoke about improving race relations and gave praise to numerous African Americans.  Near the end of the article, he wrote \"...Booker T. Washington [is] the greatest man, save General Lee, born in the South in a hundred years...\" This led to an outpouring of anger from powerful Democratic party leaders as well as the media and public.  Many demanded that Bassett be fired and encouraged parents to take their children out of the university. Resulting from immense public pressure, Bassett offered his resignation if the Board of Trustees requested that he do so.  The Board of Trustees then held a meeting to decide the fate of Bassett.  In the end, they voted 18-7 not to accept the resignation citing academic freedom.  In their decision, they wrote, \"We are particularly unwilling to lend ourselves to any tendency to destroy or limit academic liberty, a tendency which has, within recent years, manifested itself in some conspicuous instances, and which has created a feeling of uneasiness for the welfare of American colleges [...] We cannot lend countenance to the degrading notion that professors in American colleges have not an equal liberty of thought and speech with all other Americans.\" In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt commended Trinity and Bassett's courageous stand for academic freedom while speaking to the university.  He told the school, \"You stand for Academic Freedom, for the right of private judgment, for a duty more incumbent upon the scholar than upon any other man, to tell the truth as he sees it, to claim for himself and to give to others the largest liberty in seeking after the truth.\"\n\nParagraph 20: A 2015 meta-analysis found that, although a longer period of abstinence was associated with smaller magnitudes of impairment, both retrospective and prospective memory were impaired in cannabis users. The authors concluded that some, but not all, of the deficits associated with cannabis use were reversible. A 2012 meta-analysis found that deficits in most domains of cognition persisted beyond the acute period of intoxication, but was not evident in studies where subjects were abstinent for more than 25 days. Few high quality studies have been performed on the long-term effects of cannabis on cognition, and the results were generally inconsistent. Furthermore, effect sizes of significant findings were generally small. One review concluded that, although most cognitive faculties were unimpaired by cannabis use, residual deficits occurred in executive functions. Impairments in executive functioning are most consistently found in older populations, which may reflect heavier cannabis exposure, or developmental effects associated with adolescent cannabis use. One review found three prospective cohort studies that examined the relationship between self-reported cannabis use and intelligence quotient (IQ). The study following the largest number of heavy cannabis users reported that IQ declined between ages 7–13 and age 38. Poorer school performance and increased incidence of leaving school early were both associated with cannabis use, although a causal relationship was not established. Cannabis users demonstrated increased activity in task-related brain regions, consistent with reduced processing efficiency.\n\nParagraph 21: NASA launched Mercury-Atlas 9, designated Faith 7 and scheduled for a 22-orbit mission, from Cape Canaveral at 8:04 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), with astronaut L. Gordon Cooper as the pilot. This was the last mission of the Mercury program. Cooper entered the Mercury spacecraft at 5:33 a.m. the morning of May 15, and it was announced over Mercury Control by Lt. Colonel John A. Powers that \"barring unforeseen technical difficulties the launch would take place at 8:00 a.m. e.d.t.\" Cooper reported that he took a brief nap while awaiting the launch. The countdown progressed without incident until T-11 minutes and 30 seconds when some difficulty developed in the guidance equipment and a brief hold was called. Later, a momentary hold was called at T-19 seconds to determine whether the systems went into automatic sequencing, which occurred as planned. The liftoff was excellent, and visual tracking could be made for about 2 minutes through a cloudless sky. The weather was considerably clearer than on the day before. The Faith 7 flight sequencing - booster engine cut off, escape tower jettison, sustainer engine cut off - operated perfectly and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit at 8:09 a.m. EDT at a speed that was described as almost unbelievably correct. The perigee of the flight was about 100.2 statute miles, the apogee was 165.9, and Faith 7 attained a maximum orbital speed of . During the early part of the flight, Cooper was busily engaged in adjusting his suit and cabin temperatures, which were announced as  and , respectively, well within the tolerable range. By the second orbit, temperature conditions were quite comfortable, so much so, in fact, that the astronaut took a short nap. During the third orbit, Cooper deployed the flashing light experiment successfully and reported that he was able to see the flashing beacon on the night side of the fourth orbit. Thus, Cooper became the first human to launch a satellite (the beacon) while in orbital flight.\n\nParagraph 22: Easley was the fourth overall pick of the 1981 NFL Draft, selected by the Seattle Seahawks. He became an immediate starter as a rookie in 1981, recording three interceptions for 155 yards and one touchdown, earning him AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. In 1983, the Seahawks hired former Buffalo Bills coach Chuck Knox as their head coach and Easley immediately became the \"backbone\" of Knox's defense. In his first season playing for Knox, Easley won the AFC Defensive Player of the Year Award and recorded seven interceptions. In 1984, Easley led the NFL in interceptions with ten, which tied a club record. He returned two of them for touchdowns and was named as the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, the first safety awarded since Dick Anderson in 1973. In 1984, during a 45–0 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in the Kingdome on November 4, the Seahawks returned four interceptions for touchdowns, including one caught by Easley, breaking the record for most touchdowns scored from an interception in a game. He also took over the role of the team's main punt returner when Paul Johns got injured earlier in the season.\n\nParagraph 23: A woman accompanied by two dogs, one red, the other black, both with a human appearance, came down from the northwest and passing through the Flinders Ranges site of  Buðajerta ('snow country'), namely Mount Patawerta, they began to kill and eat any human they met. Word spread quickly of the imminent threat and people fled from their path. As the cannibal woman drew near to the game-rich and well-watered  camping grounds at Karuna, the Ganjamata hill people  decided to make a stand and try to kill the intruders. To this end they chose two warriors, Kudnu, the jew lizard, and Wulkinara his brother, to face the trio.  Armed with boomerangs, they set a trap near the woman and her dogs, with Wulkinara suggesting to Kudnu that he take up position in a tree, and, on sighting the woman and her hounds, make some noise to draw their attention his way, while he, Wulkinara would lay in ambush in scrub nearby. At first the dogs failed to hear the noise, but, on his brother's insistent whisper  that he yell out more audibly, Kudnu managed  to inveigle the red dog to leap up into the tree, and, just as he did, Wulkinara swung the boomerang in his right hand and, flying truly, it sliced that dog in two.  Kudnu then shouted again, and the black dog charged his hide-out, which Wulkinara also managed also  to cut it in half, throwing the other boomerang  in his left hand. They then killed the cannibalistic woman and burnt her.  The blood spilled by the slaughtered dogs left two deposits: that of the red dog became the invaluable  red ochre deposit at Parachilna Gorge, harvested by the Ngadjuri also for its medicinal properties.  The black dog's blood formed a wad of the same colour, which was used both in smearing the bodies of youths during their initiation and in dancing performances.\n\nParagraph 24: Sales in the beginning were slow because people wrongly assumed that The Sowetan had only news from Soweto. It was in fact a countrywide newspaper from the beginning and was distributed in the Transvaal, Natal, Orange Free State, with copies also going to Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. Due to the poor sales and high costs, the Port Elizabeth and Cape Town distribution was stopped after a few years. It took nearly two years before it was accepted and sales started soaring. Percy Qoboza was the editor at the time but was soon replaced by Joe Latakgomo. Latagomo started as a sports editor in 1967. Later Latakgomo left and joined The Star, after receiving death threats, and was replaced by Aggrey Klaaste, who was editor from 1988 to 2002.\n\nParagraph 25: The Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II, at the beginning of the Pacific War in December 1941, was the third most powerful navy in the world, and the naval air service was one of the most potent air forces in the world. During the first six months of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy enjoyed spectacular success inflicting heavy defeats on Allied forces, being undefeated in every battle. The attack on Pearl Harbor crippled the battleships of the US Pacific Fleet, while Allied navies were devastated during Japan's conquest of Southeast Asia. Japanese Navy aircraft operating from land bases were also responsible for the sinkings of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse which was the first time that capital ships were sunk by aerial attack while underway. In April 1942, the Indian Ocean raid drove the Royal Navy from South East Asia. After these successes, the Japanese now concentrated on the elimination and neutralization of strategic points from where the Allies could launch counteroffensives against Japan's conquests. However, at Coral Sea the Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia while the defeat at Midway saw them forced on the defensive. The campaign in the Solomon Islands, in which the Japanese lost the war of attrition, was the most decisive; they had failed to commit enough forces in sufficient time.\n\nParagraph 26: Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it wasn't until 1892 that an organized group of athletes first represented Iowa State in football. In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams. The 1894 team finished with a 6–1 mark, including a 16–8 victory over what is now the University of Iowa. One of the pioneers of football, Pop Warner, spent time at Iowa State early in his career. In 1895 despite already being the coach at Georgia he was offered $25 per week to come to Iowa State, whose season started in mid-August while Georgia's started a month later, as well as to provide weekly advice during the rest of the season. Soon after Warner left for Georgia, Iowa State had its first game of the season. Iowa State came into Evanston as the underdog Iowa State then defeated Northwestern 36–0. A Chicago sportswriter called the team \"cornfed giants from Iowa\" while the Chicago Tribune'''s headline read, \"Struck by a Cyclone\". Since then, Iowa State teams have been known as the Cyclones. Overall, the team had three wins and three losses and, like Georgia, Iowa State retained Warner for the next season. In 1896 the team had eight wins and two losses. Despite leaving Cornell in 1898, Warner remained as the head coach of Iowa State for another year. During his last three years at Iowa State the team had a winning season but Warner was unable to match his 1896 triumph. After playing at Iowa and then serving as an assistant coach for two years, Clyde Williams came to Ames as an assistant coach for ISU. Williams served as the Cyclones' head football coach for six seasons from 1907 to 1912. During that time, he had a coaching record of 32–15–2. This ranks him fifth at Iowa State in total wins and fourth at Iowa State in winning percentage. In addition, he led Iowa State to two Missouri Valley Conference football titles in 1911 and 1912, which are the only two conference football championships in school history. In addition to his football contributions Williams was the school's first men's basketball coach from 1908 to 1911, where he compiled a 20–29 record. He also served as Iowa State's baseball coach, and was their athletic director from 1914 to 1919. In 1914 Iowa State completed construction of their new football field and it was named Clyde Williams Field in honor of the former coach. Williams was inducted into the State of Iowa Hall of Fame in 1956.  He is also one of the few people inducted into both the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1993) and the Iowa State athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1997). The success Iowa State found in the inception of their football program was not replicated for most of the mid-20th century. In 1922 after having two different head coaches in as many years, ISU hired up-and-comer Sam Willaman away from East Technical HS in Cleveland, OH.  When Willaman came to Iowa state, he brought with him six of his former East Tech players, including Jack Trice.  Trice was the first African-American player at Iowa State, and one of the first African-Americans to play football in the Midwest.  Trice suffered a severe malicious injury during a game at Minnesota in 1923, and died from complications.  In 1997, Iowa State's Cyclone Stadium was renamed Jack Trice Stadium in his honor, becoming the first and as of 2020, the only, major college football stadium to be named for a black man. In his first season, Willaman's team finished with a 2–6 record, but posted a winning record in each of the three years that followed. His career coaching record at Iowa state was 14–15–3.  This ranks him 16th in total wins and 13th in winning percentage in Iowa State football history.\n\nParagraph 27: Lauren and Patty are surrounded by colorful supporting characters. Their friends Marshall Blechtman (John Femia) and Johnny \"Slash\" Ulasewicz (Merritt Butrick) are a pair of lovable geeks. Marshall is a motormouthed would-be comedian, while Johnny is a soft-spoken new wave fan (not punk... \"a totally different head... totally.\") Though seemingly off in his own reality most of the time, Johnny Slash states that he \"[does not] do drugs and isn't a hippie\" and on more than one occasion displays unexpected intuition and empathy, particularly regarding Marshall and the girls. The two help to maintain a school radio station. Several episodes indicate that Marshall is attracted to Lauren and Johnny to Patty.\n\nParagraph 28: The building was originally constructed in 1875 in Domestic Gothic Revival style by Henry Horsey and J. Sheard, architects. The first occupant was J.H. Plummer, the new Ottawa manager of the Bank of Commerce. Two years later, Télesphore Fournier, a Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, moved in with his family. It was bought by Auditor General of the Dominion’s Currency Frederick Toller in 1882. His family owned it until 1912 when it was bought by cabinet minister Louis-Philippe Brodeur who owned it until 1931. The house was owned by a group of nuns who used it as a residence and school until 1968. It was then rented out to students from the nearby University of Ottawa.  \n\nParagraph 29: Pitts Sanborn (1879–1941), was born John Pitts Sanborn in Port Huron, Michigan. He dropped the \"John\" for most of his professional career. After graduating Harvard in 1900, he established himself as a music critic, writing for the New York Globe, New York Mail and finally New York World-Telegram. As a poet he was published in Trend, for which he served as an editorial staffer beginning in 1914. As a novelist, his 1929 novel Prima Donna was called by one New York Times critic “an amazing achievement; nothing quite like it has been done in this country before.” He went on to put Sanborn in the same league with Willa Cather, Edith Wharton and Thornton Wilder. Sanborn was remarked upon as one of the great originals of 1920s-1930s culture. Sanborn's wealth of connections in intellectual and cultural circles included Van Wyck Brooks, Rosa Ponselle, Mark Van Doren and Llewelyn Jones. His friendship with Wallace Stevens (whom he met at Harvard) included a great influence upon Stevens’ interest in music and thus his poetry. He was a good friend and sometimes lover of Carl Van Vechten, who he convinced to assume editorship of Trend. He was also a radio commentator for the Philadelphia Orchestra. Sanborn died at 61 of an apparent heart attack in his Greenwich Village apartment a few hours after he had attended a performance at the Metropolitan Opera House. He had just completed the first paragraph of his review.\n\nParagraph 30: Uracil DNA glycosylases remove uracil from DNA, which can arise either by spontaneous deamination of cytosine or by the misincorporation of dU opposite dA during DNA replication.  The prototypical member of this family is E. coli UDG, which was among the first glycosylases discovered.  Four different uracil-DNA glycosylase activities have been identified in mammalian cells, including UNG, SMUG1, TDG, and MBD4.  They vary in substrate specificity and subcellular localization.  SMUG1 prefers single-stranded DNA as substrate, but also removes U from double-stranded DNA.  In addition to unmodified uracil, SMUG1 can excise 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 5-formyluracil bearing an oxidized group at ring C5.  TDG and MBD4 are strictly specific for double-stranded DNA.  TDG can remove thymine glycol when present opposite guanine, as well as derivatives of U with modifications at carbon 5.  Current evidence suggests that, in human cells, TDG and SMUG1 are the major enzymes responsible for the repair of the U:G mispairs caused by spontaneous cytosine deamination, whereas uracil arising in DNA through dU misincorporation is mainly dealt with by UNG.  MBD4 is thought to correct T:G mismatches that arise from deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine in CpG sites.  MBD4 mutant mice develop normally and do not show increased cancer susceptibility or reduced survival. But they acquire more C T mutations at CpG sequences in epithelial cells of the small intestine.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nUracil DNA glycosylases are enzymes that remove uracil from DNA. This uracil can occur through spontaneous deamination of cytosine or by the incorrect incorporation of dU opposite dA during DNA replication. The most well-known uracil DNA glycosylase is E. coli UDG. Mammalian cells have four different uracil-DNA glycosylase activities: UNG, SMUG1, TDG, and MBD4. These glycosylases differ in their substrate specificity and where they are located within the cell. \n\nSMUG1 has a preference for single-stranded DNA but can also remove uracil from double-stranded DNA. It can remove various forms of uracil, including 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil, and 5-formyluracil with oxidized groups at carbon 5. \n\nTDG and MBD4 are specific to double-stranded DNA. TDG can remove thymine glycol when it is opposite guanine and can also remove modified forms of uracil at carbon 5. MBD4 is specifically involved in repairing T:G mismatches that result from the deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine at CpG sites.\n\nIn human cells, TDG and SMUG1 are primarily responsible for repairing U:G mismatches caused by cytosine deamination, while UNG handles the repair of uracil arising from dU misincorporation. MBD4 is mostly involved in correcting T:G mismatches at CpG sites. Mutant MBD4 mice do not show increased susceptibility to cancer or reduced survival, but they do have more C to T mutations at CpG sequences in epithelial cells of the small intestine.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: The most important monuments are in the chancel and the chapel.  Behind the altar is the free-standing tomb chest of Sir Thomas St. Pol, who died in 1588, and his wife.  On the sides of the chest are pilasters decorated with acanthus leaves, and the panels between them contain shields with wreaths.  On top of the chest are effigies of a man and a woman.  The man is dressed in plate armour and is holding a sword and a prayer book. His head rests on a helmet, his feet on a cushion.  The woman is wearing a long dress, a cloak and a hat, and is holding a Bible.  Above them is a canopy carried by six pillars.  The entablature is decorated with an egg and dart frieze.  On the top of the canopy, above each pillar, is the statue of a weeping figure.  In the centre is an altar, in front of which is a kneeling female figure, and on the top is a male figure, also kneeling.  The whole monument is painted and gilded.  On the north side of the chapel is the tomb of Sir George St. Pol, who died in 1613, and his wife.  On the side of the tomb are three niches.  The central niche contains a carving of Sir George's daughter, and the lateral niches have mourning putti.  On the tomb are two recumbent effigies, each lying on their right side, propped on an elbow.  The nearer effigy is a female in mourning dress with a ruff and a hat, holding a prayer book.  Behind in a higher position on a step is a male figure in plate armour, holding a sword.  The effigies are contained in a semicircular-headed recess, the archivolt of which is decorated with roses.  The back wall has an inscribed panel surrounded by scrolls and memento mori.  At the sides are pillars supporting a frieze and an entablature.  On top of the monument are flaming urns, an achievement of arms, shields and obelisks.  In the north wall of the chapel is an alabaster painted and gilded plaque to Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick who died in 1619.  It contains a circular medallion carved with the head and shoulders of the deceased, behind which is the profile of his wife.  On each side are pilasters, and above is an entablature  carrying a coat of arms and heraldic supporters.  Underneath is a panel inscribed with a poem.  This memorial is thought to have been made by Epiphanius Evesham.  Elsewhere, on the east wall of the chapel and the south wall of the chancel, are brass memorial plaques.\n\nParagraph 2: Dr. Rex sends her to Professor Sigmund Friend, who claims that the Transformation is justified as it has led to the end of war and hate in society, along with many health benefits, in addition to the change in appearance.  When Marilyn protests that she still does not want the procedure, he has Marilyn confined to a hospital room against her will, ostensibly to psychologically examine her and cure her of her reason for refusing the procedure. Marilyn suspects that despite not being legally required, the Transformation is not optional, and is being maintained by the leaders of society to ensure conformity. Her best friend Valerie, who has already undergone the Transformation, shows no emotional reaction to Marilyn's protests, even when she is driven to tears. Marilyn realizes that no one who has undergone the Transformation remains capable of any empathy for or understanding of her. She tries to escape from the hospital, but ends up in the operating room to undergo the Transformation.\n\nParagraph 3: As a Finnish peculiarity, the law may in some cases provide that a special, out-of-court appeal measure known as \"rectification request\" (oikaisuvaatimus) be taken before an administrative court may actually hear the case. The rectification request is lodged with the public authority (or private actor using public power) that made the original decision. By means of the request, the authority may double-check its decision (to rule out potential unintentionally incorrect application of law, spelling errors etc.) and possibly modify it, in order that an undisputedly unlawfully made decision need not be settled at court. The rectification process is regulated by the Administrative Procedure Act (434/2003). If the decision is not modified through rectification, an actual appeal may (in most cases) be lodged with the administrative court. That appeals process is regulated by the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (586/1996). On appeal, the administrative court reviews the legality of the decision of the authority. The appeal may usually be made by an involved person, or by another authority charged with the supervision of public interest in the matters of its jurisdiction. Depending on the type of the case and the laws involved, the review by the administrative court may cover only the formal legality of the authority's procedure, but it may extend to the actual appropriateness of the decision. If the authority in question is overturned, the administrative court issues a decision in the case or submits it back to the authority for further consideration of facts. If the appellant or the authority is discontent with the decision of the administrative court, it is possible to appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court.  The proceedings are chiefly written, but if the case requires, the administrative courts may conduct surveys, hold oral proceedings, hear witnesses, experts or involved parties, or receive opinions from other authorities.\n\nParagraph 4: George Walton Academy was founded in 1969 during school desegregation in Good Hope, Georgia. It is now located in Monroe, Georgia and serves PK-12th grades with a student-teacher ratio of 10:1. According to brigadier general, author, and GWA alumnus Ty Seidule, the school was founded for one purpose: \"Ensure white kids didn't have to go to school with Black kids.\" Initially, the school was located in Good Hope, Georgia, where the school took over the facilities of two public schools, the previously all-white Good Hope School and the previously all-black Good Hope-Peters School. In 1975, the school moved from Good Hope to Monroe.\n\nParagraph 5: Reviewing for Rolling Stone in December 1970, Jon Landau said that Sly Stone's style is \"so infinite and revolves around so many crucial aspects that it has only come together perfectly on a handful of his singles\", the best of which are compiled on Greatest Hits. Although he found occasionally \"trite\" music and lyrics, Landau felt that most of the songs \"alone stand as a tribute to one of the most original and creative rock musicians.\" In the March 1971 edition of Ebony, Phyl Garland hailed it as among the best recent \"best of\" LPs and \"a true bonanza\" of psychedelic soul, recommended especially for fans of the genre. In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said that, although he has \"doubts\" about the band's studio albums, Greatest Hits is \"among the greatest rock and roll LPs of all time\", adding that Stone's political songs are \"uplifting but never simplistic or sentimental\". He also asserted that the music's flashy stereo separations, vocal sounds, and register alterations made Greatest Hits \"the toughest commercial experiments in rock and roll history\".\n\nParagraph 6: On 12 June, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spain national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spain national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them. The club then began aggressively re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million. Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a disgraceful 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after 10 games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari. On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain by a 4–1 margin in the FIFA Club World Cup final. With their win, Real Madrid became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles. They are considered to have been the world champions for grand total of seven times because FIFA officially recognizes the Intercontinental Cup as the predecessor of the FIFA Club World Cup. They also extended the record for most consecutive titles with their third in a row. Solari won 10 out his first 13 La Liga matches, but the team started to struggle again soon after that. First, they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 0–3 at home on 27 February 2019 after a 1–1 away draw in the first leg. Then there was another El Clásico a few days later, this time in the league, and Madrid against lost a home game to Barça, 0–1. Finally, on 5 March 2019, Real was thumped by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) in a home game, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club. Madrid went on to win five, draw two and lose four remaining league matches under Zidane, finishing third with 68 points, 12 losses and a +17 goal difference, making it Real's worst points total since 2001–02 and worst goal difference since 1999–2000. The club won one out of five possible trophies in one of the most disastrous seasons in its modern history.\n\nParagraph 7: After the match the Auckland team was chosen to play against Australia with Mincham chosen on the wing. The match was played at Carlaw Park on 14 September and before a crowd of 15,000 Auckland went down 16 points to 8. Mincham scored a try and kicked a penalty in the loss. Mincham had seemingly been moved into a more central position as his try was described: \"Mincham cut in between (Ross) McKinnon and (Ray) Hines and sent the ball along to Lou Brown. The winger made ground and then whipped an in-pass to Mincham. The centre accepted and finished off a really magnificent effort\" which made the score 8–3 in favour of the Australians. He was also involved in a break which eventually led to Bill Telford scoring. The Auckland Star stated after the match that \"Mincham was brilliant at centre at times\". Mincham was then selected for the New Zealand team to play Australia in the first test. The test was played at Carlaw Park on 28 September and saw New Zealand pull off a shock upset 22-14 before an estimated crowd of 20,000. The win was based largely on New Zealand's defence. With the \"backs taken collectively [being] uneven on attack, although some of them, notably (Arthur) Kay, Lou Brown and Mincham, teamed sweetly at times\".  Early in the game after Australia had opened the scoring with a try Mincham made \"a nice run… on the wing, [which] placed New Zealand in a good position\". Minutes later New Zealand attacked further and scored a try to level the scores. Mincham had the opportunity to kick two goals later in the match but he failed to convert either of Brown's tries with the second hitting the upright. Mincham was chosen again to play in the second test which was scheduled for the Wednesday also at Carlaw Park. New Zealand were well beaten 29-8 and Mincham was said to have been \"below form on the left wing, and was outwitted time and time again by R. Hines, his vis-s-vis\". He also had an opportunity to kick a penalty early in the second half after 3 other kickers had been used but failed. Following the loss Mincham was dropped for the third test and was replaced by his Richmond teammate Alf Mitchell with the Auckland Star saying that he \"certainly did not perform satisfactorily\". The Herald said that his dropping was \"rather surprising, as last Wednesday was the first occasion on which Mincham failed to reveal his best form this season\".\n\nParagraph 8: The Phillies were 47–58, 15 games behind the first-place Nationals, and 10 games behind the second wild card after their series against the Nationals on August 2. The Phillies started the month by taking 2 of 3 from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game 3 victory was huge for Ryan Howard, who had struggled since coming off his injury. After getting booed by striking out when the game was tied in the 8th inning with the bases loaded, Ryan Howard came through by hitting an RBI single with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to win the game and the series. The victory also put them out of last place in the NL East for the first time since June 27. The Phillies then took 1 of 3 from the Braves, a team that they got swept by in the past 2 series. In game 1 of the series, the Phillies saw their sellout streak end when the Phillies did not have a sell-out crowd. This ended their streak at 257 games, the third-longest sellout streak in MLB history. The Phillies then took 2 of 3 from the St. Louis Cardinals and came back from 3 runs down to win game 3 in extra innings. The Phillies then also took 2 of 3 from the Miami Marlins. The Phillies then split the series at 2–2 against the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds. After their game 4 win against the Reds, the Phillies moved up to third place in the division for the first time since April 12. The Phillies then pulled off a three-game sweep of the Nationals, marking their second three-game sweep of the season. The Phillies would however take just 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. To finish the month, the Phillies would pull off a comeback win against the Braves in game 1 on August 31. The Phillies ended up taking 2 of 3 from that series. They could have swept the series, but the Phillies blew a 7–3 lead in the bottom of the 9th inning in game 3. The Phillies finished August by going 17–12, their best month of the season overall so far. However, Carlos Ruiz, who had been the star of the Phillies with his remarkable performance this season, had to sit out for 4–6 weeks because of a fractured knee that took a beating throughout the month. Ruiz was replaced by Erik Kratz due to catcher Brian Schneider also suffering an injury. This month also saw a huge improvement by Kyle Kendrick. After Charlie Manuel got really disappointed in an awful outing by Kyle in a 12–6 loss when he allowed 6 runs, he has been the hottest Phillies's pitcher since. Right away in his next outing, he shut the Miami Marlins out, allowing no runs. He did the same in his next outing against a normally strong Milwaukee Brewers offense. Although in his next outing Kyle allowed a 2-run home run against the Washington Nationals, Kendrick received his 3rd win in a row when the Phillies won 4–2. Kendrick picked up his fourth win in a row when the Phillies won 3–2 against the New York Mets.\n\nParagraph 9: He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1872 to the Forty-third Congress.  He has been incorrectly labeled as a slave holder on this page who got incorrect information from an article written by the Washington Post, listing all Slave Holder officials, but unfortunately, that paper is a biased instrument of a group of people trying their hardest to disparage almost every government official who had a part in the first 120 years of this young United States.  There is no documentation to support ownership of slaves by Bigby and frankly his life was busy with education in law and then eventually becoming a judge and then a Republican Congressman for Georgia.  He openly spoke of the common behavior of those in Georgia and the poor reflection they give but makes sure to let the Speaker of the House and its members know that the Republican Party in Georgia sees the issues and is obviously afraid of being lumped in with their views and behavior. Rigby closes his speech with these heart felt feelings about the state he loves but the conflict it presents, \"The murmurs of the stream which but a few years ago rolled along in silent grandeur is not hushed by the music of the buys factory. Under the influence of their beneficent sway all the noble impulses of a generous humanity are called into action, and every one, feeling that feedom is his inheritance, strives for a higher place in the scale of an honorable manhood. In this contest the colored man is not indifferent to the claims which society has upon him, nor does he underestimate the boon which the friends of freedom have bestowed upon him. Right nobly has he acted his part since the manacles of slavery were stricken from his limbs, and he sent forth upon the mission of life with all the rights of a citizen and an equal before the law.  Nor is his mind vailed in the night of darkness which the enemies of human liberty would fain have the country believe. It is true, that in the arts and sciences, in polite literature and classic lore, the colored voting population have not yet made much advancement (only seven years has passed since emancipation is why); but they are keenly alive to all duties of good citizenship and fairly comprehend the principles of government upon which the substantial prosperity of the nation depends.  Nor has he, as a general thing, been immodest in his aspirations for positions of honor and trust. In many instances he has been compelled to seek position because there is no one of the more favored race (sarcasm) who would consent to become the exponent of the principles of his party.  It is not strange, therefore, that he has been found in conventions which made organic law, and in Legislatures which enacted the needful laws for the government of the country.  That he is worthy of the elective franchise is abundantly shown by the care and fidelity with which he has exercised it.  And that party (Republican) which conferred it upon him, and which would secure him in its peaceful enjoyment, deserves to live forever in the memory of a grateful people (for what they had done for the country as slaves).\"\n\nParagraph 10: Before the show started, a countdown timer, ticket purchase verification and concert information appeared on the homepage. Pentagon showed a colourful appearance under the four chapters under the keyword 'L:VE', which can be interpreted in various ways. After the end of the countdown, Pentagon opened the stage with intense stages such as \"Basquiat\", \"Gorilla\" and \"Can You Feel It\". After the songs, Pentagon took a breather to interact with their fans as they introduced themselves and greeted fans in various languages such as Japanese, Hindi, French, and German and more. The member apologized saying, \"We should have had a concert two weeks ago, but I'm sorry to see you only now. It's a more confusing time than ever. I am really grateful for being able to meet you on the stage like this.\" Next was, \"The Black Hall\", a song that had been much requested by their fans for the group to perform. In Chapter II - We L:ve with Color, the group performed unit stages according to the member's personality, starting with a supercool performance by Hui and Shinwon. The duo performed their unreleased self-composed song \"WTH\", which was unveiled for the first time. The second unit performance was performed by Yuto and Wooseok. They presented a fun hip-hop stage wherein they performed the tracks, \"Poison (독)\", \"Always Difficult Always Beautiful\", and \"Repeat:II (도돌이표)\". Yanan and Hongseok presented a warm winter sensibility with Ailee's \"I Will Go to You Like the First Snow\". Lastly, Yeo One and Kino showcased a rendition of Taemin's \"Move\". On this day, Jinho, a member who enlisted in the military in May, watched the performance online and communicated in real time through comments, giving a different fun and impression. Jinho showed off his strong friendship by sending passionate support to each stage of the Pentagon. Fans also responded with comments, and held comment events such as 'I love Pentagon' and 'We are always with Pentagon'. Next, Pentagon start with a classroom skit during Chapter III - We L:ve Young, where Pentagon members introduced themselves, including member Jinho to their teacher Yeo One and their new classmate Kino. They continued to present stages with their hit songs from \"Happiness\" (Korean version), \"Shine\", \"Naughty Boy\" and \"Spring Snow\". During Chapter IV - We L:ve on Stage, the group expressed the meaning of 'stage' means to them. Hui expressed that the stage is not just his workplace but also his battlefield where he feels most pressured and where he has the most hardships and where it brings him the greatest pain. The stage is also a place that brings me the greatest happiness, as well as the greatest joy and achievements. It is a space where contradicting emotions exist\". In this section, Pentagon performed never-before-seen \"Paradise (별이 빛나는 이 밤)\" and \"You Like\" as well as \"Sha La La\" and \"Daisy\". Before the final chapter We L:ve in Universe, a special video \"To Universe\" with words from Pentagon for their fans was displayed. Next was \"Nostalgia\" as an encore song where they showed the unibong choreography made by member Kino. During this stage, they were surprised by the fans from across the globe joined and sang along with them. Concluding the show, Pentagon gave fans a precious gift in the form of a track made by member Kino titled \"Eternal Flame\".\n\nParagraph 11: The Walla Walla Sweets went 28-26 in the 2014 season. They missed the playoffs by 2 games to the Yakima Valley Pippins. One of the most memorable nights in that season was a cool summer's night, the game was going in Kitsap's favor with a score of 2-1 in the top of the 4th inning, a runner on 2nd, Copper Hummel catching, and 2 outs, the pitch was delivered and the runner went. Hummel went to throw the ball but the backswing of the batter hit Hummel making him throw the ball all the way in to the mid-right outfield, the runner rounded 3rd and scored, the ruling should have been batter interference, the batter making the 3rd out and ending the inning but, the umpire never called batter interference, this in-turn caused a major uproar in the crowd and players. Head Coach J.C. Biagi went to go talk to the umpire but then retreated to the dugout but, before Biagi could get back Pitching Coach Mark Michaud yelled from the dugout \"GET THE CALL RIGHT UMP'!\" The argument with Michaud lasted about 5 minutes before Michaud was ejected and, left the field of play. Later in the game, Mikey Duarte was up to bat and turned to have the upcoming pitch hit his back instead of his side and he did get hit by the pitch. Now, in baseball if you get hit by the pitch you are awarded a walk to first base but, in some High School and Collegiate leagues, if the batter made no attempt to get out of the way of the pitch they are not awarded their base, the WCL is not one of these leagues. The umpire told Duarte to get back to the plate and finish his at-bat because he never got out of the pitch's way. Biagi got out of the dugout to complain to the umpire, except this Biagi got ejected and took 7 minutes to leave the field of play. One of the spectators claim from the crowd was \"FORGET THE UMPIRES CODE AND MAKE THE RIGHT CALL!\" The Umpires Code is a code between umpires where the other umpires will back up the umpire who made the call no matter how bad it was. Biagi and Michaud's appeal did not go their way and both were suspended for 4 games. After a five year run that included winning the Eastern division twice and one appearance in the WCL Championships, as well as impacting the community in so many ways through camps, business connections and leadership programs for children manager J.C. Biagi and pitching coach Mark Michaud stepped down. Biagi went to pursue other interests, while Michaud still lives in Walla Walla and is a full-time teacher in Milton Freewater where he also coaches boys basketball at McCloughlin High School. During the off-season, the Sweets hired Frank Mutz, former MLB pitcher, as the new head coach for 2015. The sweets averaged 1,188 fans a night drawing in 36,823 fans in 31 regular season games.\n\nParagraph 12: Later, the village head, with the support and testimonies of some villagers of the instances which had Anji (Nithiin) doing unreal things, holds Anji (Nithiin) responsible for the death of the black magician and tries to kill him, claiming that he is performing black magic. But this is stopped by the head priest, who pleads the village head to not kill Anji (Nithiin) and asks him to just expel him out of the village as a punishment. Anji (Nithiin) gets expelled out of the village, but he does not care and comes again to the village. He is stopped by the villagers, but some of them start bowing down to Anji for the support he got from Lord Hanuman. Anji (Nithiin), unable to get their point, questions them and happens to realize that the Anji (Arjun) who has been with him all these days was not visible to any other villager except him. He even tells many instances which had Anji (Arjun) with him performing unreal things. But all the villagers say that they have not seen anyone with the name Anji beside Anji (Nithiin) all these days. Later, Anji (Nithiin) realizes through the head priest that the one with the name Anji (Arjun) who has been with him all the time was none other than Lord Hanuman. Anji (Nithiin) ultimately gets shocked and realizes his mistake. He hits his head with a brick in front of Lord Hanuman's statue out of remorse and falls unconscious. He witnesses Lord Hanuman instructing him to build the dam and name it as Seethamma Thalli Dam. Anji (Nithiin) starts doing so, but the village head once again tries to kill him. This time, Lord Hanuman helps Anji (Nithiin) and beats up the villains. Finally, Anji (Nithiin), with the help of the villagers, completes the dam, thereby fulfilling his parents' dream of constructing the dam.\n\nParagraph 13: While sharing much of its body with the Montclair, the Turnpike Cruiser was distinguished by several exterior design features.  Although not legalized across the entire United States until 1958, \"Quadri-Beam\" dual headlamps were fitted as standard equipment (the only 1957 Mercury to do so, as well as one of very few cars from that year to be equipped as such); for states that still allowed the use of single headlights only, the Turnpike Cruiser also used the then-standard singles setup.  In place of contrasting paint, the scalloped tailfins were gold-anodized.  Distinguished by its retractable \"Breezeway\" rear window, the Turnpike Cruiser received a separate roofline, along with a windshield curving into the roof; the windshield was among the first to use tint to reduce solar glare.  As a consequence of the compound-curve design of the windshield, Mercury added rooftop ventilation intakes to the Turnpike Cruiser to cover a body seam, and unusually in a secondary function, each intake also housed a fake radio antenna, as the functional radio antenna was mounted on the passenger side front fender.  Coupled with the retractable rear window, the Turnpike Cruiser was among the first cars to offer flow-through ventilation; air conditioning and power side windows were additional cost options.  For 1958, the Turnpike Cruiser adapted the styling changes of the Montclair and Monterey, shifting the grilles into the front bumper.  The rear fascia multiple changes, as the gold-anodized trim was removed from the scalloped fins; \"rocket-style\" taillamps were added.  To distinguish the model line from the Montclair (and Park Lane), the Turnpike Cruiser was given gold trim for its badging (including the Mercury \"M\" grille badge).\n\nParagraph 14: The second single was nevertheless a huge country/pop success and later that year, Colter launched a nationwide tour as part of Waylon Jennings' program at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. In 1976 Colter released her second and third Capitol studio albums, Jessi and Diamond in the Rough. Both albums were as successful as Colter's 1975 album, both debuting at No. 4 on the Top Country Albums chart. The lead single from her Jessi album, \"It's Morning (And I Still Love You)\" was a Top 15 country hit in 1976 on the country charts. Her second album that year, Diamond in the Rough produced only one charting single, \"I Thought I Heard You Calling My Name\". At this point, Colter had established herself as a big-selling \"albums artist,\" rather than a casual honky-tonk hitmaker, given that her talents were far more inclined to soul-rock than to mundane country music. For the remainder of the decade, Colter toured with her husband, Waylon Jennings, and released her studio album Mirriam in 1977. She then released her next album, That's the Way a Cowboy Rocks and Rolls the following year. Her success began to decline through the remainder of the decade, with her final two albums of the decade not producing any Top 40 country hits.\n\nParagraph 15:   RKO gave Holt his first lead in the B-film The Rookie Cop. It was popular, and RKO put him in The Girl and the Gambler opposite Leo Carrillo. He was then cast as the romantic lead for the studio's biggest star, Ginger Rogers, in 5th Avenue Girl (1939). It was popular and the Los Angeles Times said Holt \"does unusually well in this\", although the New York Times thought he \"seems a trifle young to be running a great corporation\".  He was meant to play the eldest son in Three Sons (1939) with Edward Ellis, but he was withdrawn and replaced by William Gargan. He was also meant to star in a Western, Silver City, with Betty Grable, but it was not made.  In early 1940 it was announced Holt and Ginger Rogers would be reunited in an adaptation of The Enchanted Cottage. The film was not made until several years later with different stars. Instead he was assigned to play Fritz Robinson in the studio's expensive adaptation of Swiss Family Robinson (1940). He also played the lead in Laddie (1940); the Los Angeles Times called him \"engaging and capable\". Swiss Family Robinson was a financial failure and Laddie was not particularly popular.\n\nParagraph 16: Tsamis started his football career at Panetolikos youth team, at the age of 16. The team's coach at the time, Lukas Aurednik immediately recognized his rich talent and expressed flattering words about the youngster to the club's managers. The following year the coach of the team Sotiris Karpodinis took him to the preparation of the men's team. He played as a substitute in a friendly against Arta and impressed with his performance and thus established himself in the first team. He soon became an international player with the Youth and Hope national teams. A law of the regime at the time that allowed the transfer of players only within a prefecture or in a neighboring prefecture stopped the transfer of Tsamis to a team from Athens. His common spell with Apostolos Toskas in the squads of the youth national teams contributed to his desire to transfer to AEK Athens. When Branko Stanković saw him in a friendly match between Panetolikos and AEK in Agrinio, he immediately suggested his transfer, which took place in an episodic way. The then head of the group, Stamatis Papastamatiou, was forced to flee and hide Tsamis in the houses of friends and acquaintances so that he would not be claimed by the other big clubs. The transfer was completed for around 2.3 million drachmas, a record amount for the time, but the obstacles that kept coming in and delaying the issuance of a sports card to the footballer forced him to stay on the stand for about a year before he played for the first time in the second leg of the UEFA Cup against in Liverpool on November 8, 1972. Tsamis helped the club in the first difficult years, but was also in the golden era of ownership of Loukas Barlos that followed. The team of Barlos and the manager Fadrhonc, where Tsamis was a starter, exceled in Greece and abroad as they progressed to the UEFA Cup semi-final in 1977. winning 2 Championships and 1 Greek Cup including a double in 1978. Tsamis played \"box-to-box\" and certainly owed a lot to the training of Fadrhonc who worked on his talent and developed him into an ultra-modern footballer. During his spell with the yellow-black jersey he without never received a card, a fact that demonstrates in addition to his footballing acumen and his morals. He always formed a successful duo with his partners in midfield and was one of the most important footballers in the history of the club. In 1980 he left AEK and signed for Korinthos where he ended his career in 1982 at the age of just 31.\n\nParagraph 17: Mel De Lloyd began his rugby union career playing alongside his brothers at Resolven RFC, aged seventeen he then played alongside Bill Clement for Llanelli RFC, he was spotted by Eddie Waring, and was recommended to rugby league club Warrington, he made his début for Warrington on Saturday 26 September 1936, he played  in Warrington's 8-4 victory over Barrow in the 1937 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1936–37 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 23 October 1937, during World War II he appeared as a guest player for Wakefield Trinity making his début for during March 1941, playing 9-matches up to May 1941, he also he appeared as a guest player Keighley, during a game against Hull F.C. on Saturday 3 January 1942 he was sent off after disputing a decision by the referee, Mr L. Dolby, alleged that De Lloyd had later \"struck him\", on Wednesday 7 January 1942, the Rugby Football League disciplinary committee suspended De Lloyd indefinitely (sine die), the suspension was lifted 10-months later in October 1942, he resumed playing having missed 14-games, he scored 1-try, 3-conversions, and 3-drop goals for a total of 15-points in the 21-0 victory over Huddersfield in the first leg of the 1943 Yorkshire County Cup semi-final during the 1943–44 season at Lawkholme Lane on Saturday 13 November 1943, during his time at Keighley they appeared in two Yorkshire Cup finals, the only Yorkshire Cup finals that Keighley have appeared in, the 7-10 aggregate defeat (2-5 at Odsal Stadium on Saturday 27 November 1943, and 5-5 at Lawkholme Lane on Saturday 4 December 1943) to Bradford Northern in the 1943 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1943–44 season, and the 3-17 defeat by Wakefield Trinity in the 1951 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1951–52 season at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield on Saturday 27 October 1951, after the war he resumed playing for Warrington, playing his last game for them on Saturday 11 October 1947, he then signed for Keighley in 1947, eventually retiring from playing in 1952, he appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia) for Wakefield Trinity, nor Keighley, but prior to the 1974–75 season all goals, whether; conversions, penalties, or drop-goals, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.\n\nParagraph 18: Morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences are traditional, recurring conferences held by medical services at academic medical centers, most large private medical and surgical practices, and other medical centers. Their use in psychiatric medicine is less prevalent. Death, deterioration and complications may be unavoidable in some patients due to underlying disease processes. However they may also be associated with errors or omissions in patient care. M&M conferences involve the analysis of adverse outcomes in patient care through peer review. The objectives of a well-run M&M conference are to identify adverse outcomes associated with medical error, to modify behavior and judgment based on previous experiences, and to prevent repetition of errors leading to complications. Conferences are non-punitive and focus on the goal of improved patient care. The proceedings are generally kept confidential by law. M&M conferences occur with regular frequency, often weekly, biweekly or monthly, and highlight recent cases and identify areas of improvement for clinicians involved in the case. They are particularly important for identifying systems issues (e.g., outdated policies, changes in patient identification procedures, arithmetic errors, etc.) which affect patient care.\n\nParagraph 19: The major challenge for binary XML is to create a single, widely adopted standard. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) published the Fast Infoset standard in 2007 and 2005, respectively. Another standard (ISO/IEC 23001-1), known as Binary MPEG format for XML (BiM), has been standardized by the ISO in 2001. BiM is used by many ETSI standards for digital TV and mobile TV. The Open Geospatial Consortium provides a Binary XML Encoding Specification (currently a Best Practice Paper) optimized for geo-related data (GML) and also a benchmark to compare performance of Fast InfoSet, EXI, BXML and deflate to encode/decode AIXM.\n\nParagraph 20: Dillon Phillips is twelve years old, and also burdened with a father who is the Prime Minister and has just been voted \"Naffest Man in Britain\" by his favourite pop magazine. His dad's smarmy and unlikeable spin doctor, Duncan Packer, interferes with everything and the slightest bit of bad behaviour may trigger an international crisis. Dillon's mother, Clare, is a successful businesswoman and has little time for him, while his older sister, Sarah, is annoyingly bossy and dismissive of her brother and his problems: however, the pair do occasionally join forces in order to fight against their oppressive regime, and especially against Packer. At school, Dillon's only real friend is a boy known as 'Geezer', the other boys (a boy known as 'Flash', his main nemesis, in particular) frequently picking on him because of his father's position, especially when the latter shows him up, for example by arriving at the school's sports day in a helicopter. Dillon achieves some solace through imagining himself as a feisty, Jeremy Paxman-style, newsreader and interviewer, constantly interrogating his parents and sister and the odious Packer on matters that impinge on him. Most episodes open and close with these 'fantasy' newsflashes. He also occasionally gets some support from his kindly paternal grandmother, who takes surprisingly little interest in Michael's political career, preferring instead to focus on the achievements of her other son and her grandchildren.\n\nParagraph 21: Robert first showed up in Port Charles under suspicious circumstances, tracking Luke and Alexandria Quartermaine in search of an ugly black statue called \"The Ice Princess\" which in reality was a large uncut diamond that had a secret formula which could create carbonic snow, which could either help in medical procedures to fix severe burns or in the wrong hands create world mayhem. For months, Luke and Robert believed each other to be the enemy, but when Luke learned the truth about the Ice Princess offered to work with Robert to stop the insane Cassadine family who was bent on world domination. Robert was joined in Port Charles by Agent O'Reilly (Billie Hayes). a feisty older woman who kept him on his toes and unfortunately ended up being murdered by the Cassadines. Because of her death, a vengeful Robert and Luke immediately boarded the Cassadine Yacht, \"The Titan\", finding Laura there, and stayed out of sight until they got to the private island where Mikkos Cassadine revealed his plans to his esteemed group of guests. Robert, Luke and Laura found help from Tiffany Hill, the mistress of Victor Cassadine who wanted to stop Mikkos from going through with his evil plans. While Robert and Laura held Mikkos's guards at gunpoint, Luke confronted Mikkos which resulted with Mikkos freezing to death in his own ice chamber and Luke frantically trying to guess the code to unfreeze Port Charles. Luke succeeded, and they all returned to Port Charles as heroes, with Tiffany joining them. Luke and Robert agreed the formula and the ice machine needed to be destroyed to avoid the risk of falling into the wrong hands. Robert left the W.S.B. over disagreements over destroying the ice machine and formula, and for a while dated Tiffany, but the spark that had captured them on the island fizzled after a while. Robert was Luke's best man when he married Laura in a big ceremony in November 1981. At the wedding, Robert was reacquainted with Mikkos's vengeful widow, Helena Cassadine, who came to town to make a huge donation to General Hospital but secretly put a curse on Luke and Laura.\n\nParagraph 22: 1947 was an exceptionally successful year for Daly. He became the first Irish winner of the Open Championship, the first Irish winner of the News of the World Match Play and the first Irishman to play in the Ryder Cup. He was the first Irishman to win an important professional tournament in Great Britain. 1947 was a busy season on the British circuit with a number of new tournaments. Daly played in three events before the Open, finishing third in the Daily Mail Tournament, tied for third in the Spalding Tournament and tied for seventh in the Manchester Evening Chronicle Tournament. The Open Championship was held at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake. After a first round 73, Daly scored 70, the best round of the day, to lead by four strokes. On the final morning Daly scored 78 and was in a four-way tie for the lead. Reg Horne set an early target, finishing on 294. Daly had played well on the back-9 until he took a double-bogey 6 at the 17th. Needing a par-4 at the last to tie with Horne, he holed a 10-yard putt to lead by one. The American amateur Frank Stranahan came to the last hole needing an eagle-2 to tie Daly. He nearly holed his second shot and finished tied with Horne for second place. The following week Daly defended his Irish Open title. He led after two rounds but had a disappointing final day and finished tied for 4th place. Daly returned to competitive golf in September, qualifying as the Northern Ireland representative for the final stages of the News of the World Match Play. Daly won his early matches comfortably and then beat Henry Cotton in the semi-final and Flory Van Donck in the final to take the title. He was just the second player, after James Braid in 1905, to win the two most important British tournaments in the same year. Daly finished the British season by competing in the Dunlop Masters, where he finished tied for 9th.\n\nParagraph 23: Leonardos talks of the bonds between Greece and Russia. From Greek Mystras to Catholic Rome, and from there to medieval Moscow, the life of Zoe-Sophia Palaiologina traces the collapse of one civilisation and the rise of a new one. Heir to the imperial titles of the Second Rome, vanquished Constantinople, the daring Byzantine princess managed to escape Rome and, as the wife of Ivan III, create the Third Rome from the emerging Russian Empire. The first Tsarina in Russian history, the avowed enemy of the Tatars who had Russian lands under their rule, comes alive in the pages of his new historical novel by George Leonardos, and sheds light on aspects of history that are not widely known. Historical scholarship, a thrilling adventure, a reminder of the true power of Orthodoxy and of Russia, in a plot that thunders forward like a juggernaut. The novel depicts the developing relations between the Byzantine Empire and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The bonds strengthened after the marriage of Zoe-Sophia Palaiologos, niece of the last Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos who fell defending the City against the Ottoman army, to Ivan III the Great, himself a descendant of the Rurik Dynasty. With the help and at the instigation of his Greek consort, Ivan III managed to reject Tatar rule and unite the fragmented principalities and hegemonies under a large, and powerful central leadership, the predecessor to today’s Russia. Because of his marriage to Sophia Palaiologos, the sole heir to the Byzantine Empire, he also succeeded in making his state the heir to the vanquished and fragmented Eastern Roman Empire, and thus adopted the Empire’s symbols, such as the double-headed eagle, and also became a power in the Orthodox world, declaring Moscow the Third Rome, after Rome itself and Constantinople. The novel begins in Rome where Zoe Palaiologina was raised and describes the machinations of the Greek Orthodox and later Catholic Cardinal Bessarion and a series of Popes, the last of whom was Sixtus IV, to marry Zoe off to Ivan III, then Grand Duke of Moscow, so that she could convert the Russians to Catholicism. As soon as she planted her feet on Russian soil, Sophia’s Byzantine Orthodoxy awoke and she changed her name to Sophia, as the Russians considered the name Zoe to be Catholic. At Sophia’s instigation – she often nagged him that she had not “married to become a vassal of the Tatar infidels” – Ivan managed to overthrow Tatar hegemony over the Russian people, particularly after the bloodless confrontation in the Ugra River, and make his domains a powerful state. It was for this reason, as well as his patriotism and policies that Ivan III was proclaimed ‘the Great’, the first in Russian history. Ivan’s and Sophia’s grandson was Ivan the Terrible.\n\nParagraph 24: The casino houses multiple restaurants. Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill is an English pub, a type of restaurant Ramsay felt was \"missing on the strip\". The Nobu Restaurant is an Asian restaurant. The Old Homestead Steakhouse is the first west-coast location of a New York restaurant chain. Rao's opened in 2006, the second branch of the restaurant after New York City to open. Flay's first restaurant venture outside New York, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill was opened at Caesars in 2004 and featured southwestern cuisine; it closed in November 2020 and was replaced in early 2021 with a \"fish-and-pasta\" concept called Amalfi by Bobby Flay. Chef Brian Malarkey opened Searsucker Las Vegas – the fourth branch of the restaurant after San Diego, Del Mar, California, and Austin, Texas – in March 2015. The  dining area has a \"retro Americana\" theme, with \"cowboy culture\" motifs reflected throughout the furnishings and paintings designed by Thomas Schoos.  Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a Chinese restaurant with an overhead metal-cut white screen and large aquariums filled with goldfish are all backlit by LED bulbs. Serendipity 3 was a 1950s style diner, featuring burgers, fries and ice cream delicacies. The ice cream parlor themed restaurant, which was a branch of the New York City Serendipity 3 establishment, opened in 2009. In addition to seating in the dining area and counter seating, there was a patio with views of the Strip and the Caesars Palace fountains. It closed on January 2, 2017. Hell's Kitchen opened in its place in January 2018, and was originally planned to be used as the studio for the filming of the American television show Hell's Kitchen for Seasons 19 and 20, but with full bookings of customers to serve and a lack of cameras (and no dormitories for the contestants), shooting was instead moved to the Caesars Entertainment Studios property near the Las Vegas Strip. The major restaurant of the Augustus Tower is the Guy Savoy, namesake of the three-star Michelin chef. When Savoy was approached to open a second restaurant in Vegas, he initially said no, until Caesars told him they wanted him to recreate what he had done in Paris. His request was that to maintain quality, the restaurant must be limited to service five days a week, to which the management agreed. The restaurant opened in 2006 and in 2008, Savoy brought his executive chef from the Paris restaurant to Vegas. \n\nParagraph 25: Virgil begins his poem with a dedication to Maecenas, then a summary of the four books, followed by a prayer to various agricultural deities as well as Augustus himself. It takes as its model the work on farming by Varro, but differs from it in important ways. Numerous technical passages fill out the initial half of the first book; of particular interest are lines 160–175, where Virgil describes the plow. In the succession of ages, whose model is ultimately Hesiod, the age of Jupiter and its relation to the golden age and the current age of man are crafted with deliberate tension.  Of chief importance is the contribution of labour to the success or failure of mankind's endeavours, agricultural or otherwise.  The book comes to one climax with the description of a great storm in lines 311–350, which brings all of man's efforts to nothing.  After detailing various weather-signs, Virgil ends with an enumeration of the portents associated with Caesar’s assassination and civil war; only Octavian offers any hope of salvation.\n\nParagraph 26: Anatoly Sukhorukov has derived the general paraxial equation describing beam diffraction in anisotropic crystals, and originated the paraxial theory for three-wave interactions of beams and pulses under the presence of phase- and group-velocity mismatches, diffraction, and group velocity dispersion. He has developed a spatio-temporal analogy between optical beams and pulses, and predicted the effect of diffraction-dispersion incoherence for modulated waves, which limits the efficiency of frequency conversion and results in parametric mutual focusing in quadratic media. He has also predicted the phenomenon of anomalous diffraction in the parametric amplifier, and determined the optimal conditions for high-efficiency generation of the second and third harmonics in focused laser beams. He has first investigated the possibility of total energy conversion in the process of double phase-matched interaction between three frequency harmonics. He has developed the theory of up- and down parametric frequency conversion under the presence of group velocity mismatch, described the formation of three-frequency optical dissipative solitons, parametric pi – pulses, a giant parametric pulse (confirmed experimentally), calculated the modes of the parametrical amplifier with a pulsed pump, developed the theory of stimulated Raman scattering taking into account the relaxation time and group velocity mismatch, found the quasi-phase-matching conditions for slow and fast modes in 3D photonic crystals. He has predicted the existence of a new class of localized structures – parametric three-frequency solitons in media with quadratic nonlinearity (results published in 1974, confirmed experimentally in 1995), also discovered a new type of wave self-focusing, namely, mutual – focusing of just three beams at different frequencies in quadratic media. He has investigated the walk-off effect on quadratic solitons, analyzed dynamics of spatial soliton trapping and interactions in bulk media, in cavities (based on the full round-trip model), in gratings (model for counter-propagating waves); proposed parametric soliton model based on the analogy with coupling of three quasi-particles; considered the tunneling of slow parametric solitons through a bounded grating. He has analyzed the quasi-phase-matched hybrid interactions in periodically polled crystals (layer model), asymmetric modes of parametric solitons, properties of ultra-narrow quadratic solitons, propagation of ultra-short optical pulses inducing plasma generation, and parametric interactions of two non-axial vortices, methods of spatio-temporal vortices generation and recording, all-optical switching with parametric refraction and reflection. He developed the theory of dispersion managed interactions of few-cycle pulses in quadratically nonlinear layered media. He has investigated the nonlinear refraction, total internal reflection and scattering of optical beams and pulses in defocusing media with Kerr, cascaded quadratic, photorefractive, and thermal nonlinearities.\n\nParagraph 27: The next day, Barlow played a decisive role in the Battle of High Bridge near Farmville, Virginia. Barlow was pursuing Confederate troops who had crossed High Bridge the previous day. The Confederate troops included men led by Gen. Gordon, who at the time believed that he had killed Barlow at the Battle of Gettysburg. The Battle of High Bridge included two skirmishes, the first of which took place in the evening of April 6, prior to Barlow's arrival. Confederate forces captured roughly 800 men and wounded or killed others. They then planned to destroy the bridge afterward in order to prevent its use by Union forces. However, a delay in sending an order to destroy the bridge proved to be advantageous for Barlow's men, who arrived in the early morning of April 7 to find the lower level of the bridge in flames and collapsing. Barlow commanded some of his men to charge the bridge and put out the fire, and the second skirmish of the battle ensued. Union forces successfully crossed the upper level of the bridge and fought with the Confederates. The Confederate forces eventually retreated towards Appomattox Station, away from Farmville, where they hoped to find food and supplies. These actions by Barlow and his men potentially shortened the war by several days and put additional pressure on Gen. Robert E. Lee to surrender.\n\nParagraph 28: After a coaching change with the Giants in 2004 he joined the Buffalo Bills coaching staff as the running backs coach under offensive coordinator Tom Clements. The Bills would finish the season 9-7, their last winning record until the 2014 season, by scoring 24.6 points a game, with Bills running backs 13th in the NFL in rushing. Studesville is largely given credit for the emergence of Willis McGahee, who, after recovering from a catastrophic knee injury sustained in college, gained 1297 yards from scrimmage. In 2005, the running game was the main highlight of an otherwise stagnant team led by journeyman Kelly Holcomb and 2nd year quarterback J. P. Losman, as the Bills finished 5-11 while McGahee gained 1,425 yards from scrimmage. In 2006, Mularkey was fired and Dick Jauron was brought on to replace him; Jauron would keep Studesville as the team's running backs coach under offensive coordinator Steve Fairchild. After a pedestrian year for the Bills rushing attack spearheaded by Willis McGahee and Anthony Thomas in 2006 (the same year that Division III Coe College product Fred Jackson was recruited to the Bills by its then-general manager and fellow alum Marv Levy and remained on the practice squad that season), in 2007, the Bills drafted Marshawn Lynch who gained 1299 yards in his rookie season under Studesville's tutelage. 2007 also saw Fred Jackson's call-up from the practice squad and emergence as a threat, as he played in 8 games and gained nearly 500 yards from scrimmage while maintaining a special teams role as well. 2008, under new offensive coordinator Turk Schonert, the Bills offense experienced a renewed commitment to its running backs and Studesville pupils Lynch and Jackson combined for 2,224 yards from scrimmage. 2009 brought about an unsettled year for the Bills offense, as Turk Schonert was fired midway through training camp with former Bills quarterback and quarterbacks coach Alex Van Pelt being appointed in his stead. Studesville's charges saw a reversal of fortunes, as Lynch experienced injuries and off-the-field troubles leading to a suspension, and Fred Jackson led the way with 1,433 yards from scrimmage as they combined for a total of 2,062 between Jackson and Lynch. Head coach Dick Jauron was fired midway through the season and replaced by interim head coach Perry Fewell for the remainder of the season. The entire Bills staff was let go following the 2009 season. Studesville would not be retained under new head coach Chan Gailey.\n\nParagraph 29: Rodney Hatch, a barber, is engaged to Gloria Kramer. While visiting an art museum, he feels drawn to a sculpture of Venus the Roman goddess of love, though the other patrons dismiss it as out of step with the current art trends. On a whim, Rodney puts his engagement ring on the statue's finger, causing the statue to come to life. Venus falls in love with Rodney for giving her life and begins pursuing him, causing turmoil in his relationship with Gloria. When Venus becomes annoyed with Gloria, she transports her to the North Pole. Adding further complications, with the statue gone from the museum, Rodney is arrested for art theft, but Venus helps him escape. Rodney begins to fall in love with the goddess, but their time together is cut short when she is called away by the gods, and becomes a statue again. When Gloria returns from the North Pole she is furious with Rodney and breaks off their engagement. Rodney returns to the museum and looks at the statue again. He unexpectedly bumps into a young woman from out of town who bears a striking resemblance to the statue. Rodney leaves the museum with her, and as she starts to tell him her name he responds 'You don't have to tell me. I know.'\n\nParagraph 30: The success of AKAT-1 enabled Karpiński to be put forward by Poland as its candidate for the UNESCO worldwide award for young engineers in 1960. Karpiński's work was evaluated with around 200 other contestants by an UNESCO international committee, and he turned out to be among the six laureates. As a reward, he was allowed to go on a half-year scholarship in the United States to visit major technological centres in the country. During the scholarship, which has been eventually extended to a full year, Karpiński managed to visit around twenty universities and laboratories, among them Computation Laboratory at Harvard, Caltech, UCLA and Los Alamos National Laboratory. During his stay he met with a number of leading computer scientists of the time including John Eckert, Claude Shannon and Edward F. Moore. Despite the numerous offers to stay in the United States and move his work there, Karpiński decided to come back to Poland. Later, it emerged that before and during his stay in the United States, Karpiński cooperatated with Polish intelligence to collect data, which sparked controversies around his person. Karpiński himself, interviewed on the matter after the fall of communism, was reluctant to comment the matter, but insisted the agreement with intelligence officer cpt.
