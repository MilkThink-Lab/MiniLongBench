Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nSycamore, Illinois (CNN) The man convicted in the oldest cold case ever brought to court broke into a wide grin as a judge ordered him released from prison Friday and granted him a new trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, 76, was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the judge's ruling, McCullough turned toward his stepdaughter, Janey O'Connor, and flashed her a private signal that she says means \"I love you.\" She was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria Ridulph's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, \"Taken,\" raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the aisle, Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He repeated the alibi when he spoke with CNN in prison in March 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They proved nothing,\" he said at the time. \"I am in here for murder. A murder I would not, could not have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough said that when Maria was kidnapped, the telephone in his home in Sycamore was ringing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And I was on the other end of that phone, in Rockford, three minutes before she was kidnapped. Try and make that happen. Only Scotty could make that happen, if he beamed me up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, in prison after his 2012 conviction. Now a judge has ordered him freed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Illinois appeals court upheld his conviction last year. But McCullough made a last-ditch appeal in a jailhouse motion last December, saying police and prosecutors buried evidence supporting his alibi. He asked a judge to find him innocent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who inherited the case from predecessor Clay Campbell, was placed in the position of having to defend the conviction. He launched a six-month investigation that included a review of some 4,500 pages of documents -- old police and FBI reports, grand jury transcripts, trial transcripts, affidavits for search and arrest warrants, and even CNN's five-part series on the case, \"Taken,\" which raised questions about whether the courtroom reconstruction of history was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack concluded that he'd found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough had been convicted of a crime he didn't commit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUST WATCHED Taken: The coldest case ever solved Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Taken: The coldest case ever solved 02:18 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dark-haired second-grader with big brown eyes was with her playmate, Kathy Sigman, on December 3, 1957 when they were approached by a stranger who said his name was Johnny. He gave Maria two piggyback rides, Sigman told police at the time. Sigman, now a grandmother known as Kathy Chapman, said she went home to fetch her mittens. When she returned, Maria and Johnny were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, at times walking hand-in-hand in a grid pattern. And within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects -- including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared. Despite the work of nearly three-dozen FBI agents, the investigation turned up no solid leads to Maria's whereabouts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. She was under a fallen tree, some 100 miles from home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because Maria apparently never left Illinois, the FBI pulled out of the investigation and the case went cold for half a century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Illinois State Police began to look into the Ridulph case again in 2008, after McCullough's half sister, Janet Tessier, emailed a tip. She said her dying mother had pulled her close some 14 years earlier and whispered, \"Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough was questioned in Seattle and arrested in late June 2011. A judge hearing the case without a jury found McCullough guilty after a week-long trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, the state's attorney, said he sat through the trial and always doubted whether there was enough evidence to support the conviction. In his review of the case, he said he found new evidence that verified McCullough's long-standing alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He subpoenaed records from AT&T and found that a collect call had indeed been placed at 6:57 p.m. to McCullough's home in Sycamore from a pay phone at the post office in downtown Rockford on on December 3, 1957 -- just as McCullough said he had done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At his sentencing, McCullough vehemently professed his innocence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Look in the box. The truth is in the box,\" he said, pointing to a cardboard box in the courtroom. It was filled with old FBI reports and other documents that the judge, James Hallock, kept from the trial, saying it was inadmissible hearsay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutor Richard Schmack reviewed the case and asked for McCullough to go free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack did look at those documents. He built a timeline based on the statements of 21 people -- Maria Ridulph's family members, friends, neighbors and passersby -- that confirmed the FBI's original timeline ruling out McCullough as a suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria was taken that day some time between 6:45 and 7 p.m. -- and not as early as 6 p.m., as alleged during McCullough's trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would have been impossible for him to have been in two places at once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campbell, the state's attorney who brought the case, was defeated by Schmack in an election just weeks after McCullough was convicted. Campbell has declined to comment since Schmack released his findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cold cases are particularly difficult to prosecute because evidence is often lost or destroyed, memories fade and witnesses die. And so questions have lingered over the evidence used to convict McCullough -- and whether it was strong enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No physical evidence ties him to the crime.\nPassage 2:\nSYCAMORE, Ill. --A 76-year-old man from Washington state who a prosecutor says was wrongly convicted in the abduction and killing of a 7-year-old Illinois schoolgirl in 1957 will be released from prison, a judge ordered Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH: \"48 Hours:\" Cold as Ice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing, presided over by Judge William P. Brady, was held in Sycamore, about 70 miles west of Chicago and near where Maria Ridulph was abducted as she played in the snow. Forest hikers found the girl's remains five months later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, another judge convicted Jack McCullough in Maria's death, in one of the oldest unsolved U.S. cases ever to go to trial. McCullough was sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough, in handcuffs, appeared shaken by the judge's decision at first, rocking back and forth, then taking a deep breath. Family members behind him hugged and cried. Moments later, McCullough looked back and smiled broadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other side of the room, Maria's brother and sister displayed little emotion as the hearing ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady said McCullough would be released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge pointed to several factors in his decision, including records that support McCullough's long-held contention that he was about 40 miles away from Sycamore when Maria was abducted. That evidence included newly discovered phone records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't clear until the last minute the Brady would rule as he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rest assured I am not trying this case ... You will not hear the words, 'Mr. McCullough is guilty' or 'Mr. McCullough is not guilty' coming from my mouth.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady's ruling was prompted by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack after the 2012 conviction. Schmack concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's disappearance made headlines nationwide in the 1950s, when reports of child abductions were rare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had been playing outside in the snow with a friend on Dec. 3, 1957, when a young man approached, introduced himself as \"Johnny\" and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to grab mittens, and when she came back, Maria and the man were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At trial, prosecutors said McCullough was Johnny, because he went by John Tessier in his youth. They said McCullough, then 18, dragged Maria away, choked and stabbed her to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who wasn't involved in McCullough's case and was elected to the state's attorney post as McCullough's trial came to an end, filed a scathing report with the court last month that appeared to pick the case apart, point-by-point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's long-held alibi was that he was in Rockford, attempting to enlist with the U.S. Air Force at a military recruiting station, on the night Maria disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack said newly discovered phone records proved McCullough had, as he long-claimed, made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford - which is 40 miles northwest of where Maria was abducted between 6:45 p.m. and 6:55 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack also reviewed police reports and hundreds of other documents, including from the Air Force recruitment office, which he said had been improperly barred at trial. In his review he said the documents contained \"a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs; McCullough's picture stood out, partially because everyone but him wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's murder haunted the Sycamore for decades, and McCullough's conviction four years ago seemed to bring some closure. Those wounds now threaten to reopen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family remains convinced that McCullough is guilty and have sought the appointment of a special prosecutor in an attempt to keep him behind bars. Maria's brother, 70-year-old Charles Ridulph, still lives in Sycamore and has said in recent weeks that his family feels let down by the state prosecutor's office about-face.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:\n",

            "A man convicted four years ago in the oldest cold case ever tried was freed Friday after an Illinois judge vacated his conviction and subsequent life sentence, CNN reports. According to CBS News, 76-year-old Jack McCullough was convicted of kidnapping a 7-year-old girl, choking her, and stabbing her to death in 1957. The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened. But his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup, and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier. That info wasn't allowed at McCullough's trial either. No physical evidence was ever found to support McCullough's conviction."

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nCigarette smoke has long been known to have a multitude of damaging effects, but thanks to recent research we now know it also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, in a press release. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, sought to find potential ties between the increased occurrences of MRSA cases in smokers. In order to do so, Crotty Alexander and her team tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Macrophages, or immune cells known to devour infectious ages, were infected with both types of MRSA (smoke exposed and not) to test the immune response. Although both were able to take up the populations of MRSA, macrophages fighting MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time killing them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that this type of MRSA was more resistant to the reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Even more alarming was researchers’ discovery that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, assisting in the success of their invasion. This effect depended strongly on dose; the more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, the data suggest that through altering the cell walls of the bacteria, cigarette smoke allows MRSA to repel common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA’s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor,\" Crotty Alexander said. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.

Infection and Immunity. 2015.\nPassage 2:\nCigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses, according to a new study led by UC San Diego scientists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill, said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crotty Alexander is senior author of the paper, published Monday in the journal Infection and Immunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is similar to one published last May, in which the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance was examined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. — Hayne Palmour IV Share Photo  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ✉ Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. — Hayne Palmour IV NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, Crotty Alexander said. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MRSA exposed to the smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Crotty's team found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worse, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions. At that rate, a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we put these cigarette smoke-exposed bacteria into mice, there was a significant difference in mortality,\" compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed, Crotty Alexander said in a phone interview Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cigarette smoke helped the bacteria kill more mice, whereas the e-cigarette vapor was just on the borderline,\" Crotty Alexander said. \"It did make it a little more aggressive, but not as much as the cigarette smoke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. — NIAID Share Photo  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ✉ Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. / NIAID NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study stated it was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The alternative is that smoke actually makes the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for that alternative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Because MRSA causes severe pneumonia more often than MSSA, and because MRSA commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and airways and thus is exposed to inhaled substances, we examined the effect of cigarette smoke on MRSA resistance to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice,\" the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests on human cells found the same result, Crotty Alexander said. Previous research has shown that cigarette smoke harms human respiratory and immune cells, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the picture now is that cigarette smoke both harms smokers and assists pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Study co-authors include Elisa K. McEachern, John H.

            "Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough. But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia. (The latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus.)"

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nA blood pattern analysis of the Shroud of Turin has revealed that there's just absolutely no way the stains could have been made by a body laying flat on the fabric. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pair of researchers have found that the blood-like splotches on the linen cloth are inconsistent with each other - some can only have occurred by a person standing upright, while another is completely unrealistic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The famous length of fabric, which bears the image of a man, has long been thought to be the cloth that once wrapped the body of Christian figurehead Jesus of Nazareth. The imprint is said to have been transferred during the three days his body was interred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientific analysis has not yet yielded an answer as to how the image was created on the fabric, but several reddish stains consistent with the reported crucifixion wounds of Jesus of Nazareth contain iron oxide - which could be from pigment, or could be from blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, radiocarbon techniques have dated the shroud to between 1260 and 1390 CE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The weave and the fabricweave and the fabric are both consistent with the Jesus of Nazareth time frame, as well as the Middle Ages; analysis of the cloth shows inconclusive evidence for pigment; and research determining a Middle Eastern provenance for pollen found on the cloth was later disavowed by one of its authors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radiocarbon dating notwithstanding, it would be fascinating to know exactly how the shroud was made; and, if it's real, it could reveal new information about crucifixion techniques. Because evidence for the shroud's authenticity has been so inconclusive, there has been recent scientific interest in using forensic techniques to investigate it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is where forensic anthropologist Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences enter the picture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather than testing the substance itself, the researchers used a live subject and a mannequin to analyse the blood flow on wounds on the left hand, the forearms, the \"lance wound\" in the torso, and blood stains around the figure's waist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The technique is called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis; for this, they used two types of blood: human blood donated for the research, and synthetic blood with the same fluid properties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers studied the flow for different positions: on the back of the hand in contact with wood, to observe the pattern left on the hand; on the left forearm, with blood trickling from the hand, in a standing position, and again in a supine (lying on the back) position with the hand covering the groin, as seen on the shroud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also investigated the short trickles on the back of the left hand; and the blood over the spear wound, as well as the lumbar region, thought to be blood flow from that wound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wood test was inconclusive, but the blood flow tests show that the shroud is a mess. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For starters, the trickles on the back of the hand and the flow along the arm occurred at two completely different angles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trickles from the hand as seen on the shroud occurred in the tests with the arms at a 45 degree angle, but that just doesn't work for the supposed position of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The angle between the arm and the body must be greater than 80° and smaller than 100° in order for the rivulets to flow from the wrist toward the elbow on the outer part of the forearm, as it appears on the Shroud,\" the researchers wrote in their paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Borrini & Garlaschelli/Journal of Forensic Science) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spear wound bled in a direction consistent with the Shroud image when the test subject was upright, as would occur if the victim were pierced while hanging crucified, but with one key difference: it formed rivulets, rather than a solidly filled stain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for the lower back stain, the scientists could not replicate it at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They attempted it with both bleeding from a supine position, as well as a test subject that had been standing and then laid on its back, and nothing managed to produce a \"blood belt\" in the lower back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Assuming that the red stains on the Turin linen are actually blood from the crucifixion wounds, the results of the experiments demonstrate that the alleged flowing patterns from different areas of the body are not consistent with each other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even supposing possible different episodes of bleeding (e.g., movements of the body, postmortem bleeding), these are not only non-documented, but also, as for the lumbar stains, they appear to be unrealistic,\" the researchers wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The inconsistencies identified by the authors seem not only to point against their own reality, but against the authenticity of the Shroud itself, suggesting that the Turin linen was an artistic or 'didactic' representation from the XIV century.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That doesn't mean the show is entirely over yet: until scientists are able to figure out exactly how the image was formed on the fabric, it's going to remain a tantalising scientific mystery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their findings have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences.\nPassage 2:\nThe Shroud of Turin, which has been revered by some Christians as the burial cloth of Jesus, could be a fake, according to a new forensic investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation into the bloodstain pattern on the cloth was reported Tuesday in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud shows the image of a crucified man and has been analyzed and scrutinized for many, many years. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic—and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, more than 2 million people saw the Shroud of Turin, which is 14-feet-long, 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers concluded that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, reports BuzzFeed News, adding evidence to claims that it is a fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,” Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News. “Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borrini and his colleagues used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points shown on the shroud, researchers could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction depicted on the linen. They found bloodstains that were inconsistent with any single pose, which seems to suggest a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11-MILLION-TON ICEBERG THREATENS TO INUNDATE TINY GREENLAND VILLAGE WITH TSUNAMI NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it was truly the death shroud of someone hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BuzzFeed reports that researchers found forearm rivulets matched an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone. “This is just not what happens to a person on a cross,” Borrini said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Overall, the approach is founded in science and the methodology sound,” bloodstain pattern expert Jonathyn Priest of Bevel, Gardner and Associates Inc. told BuzzFeed News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Priest cautioned that the conclusions were based on body parts held in a fixed position, rather than accounting for carrying a body, cleaning a body, or preparing a body for burial, which might bear more study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The fact that flowing bloodstains exist at all on a deceased body that was reportedly cleaned also raises questions,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although this latest research is not definitive, generations of the faithful will continue to be fascinated by the Shroud of Turin.\nPassage 3:\n“This is just not what happens to a person on a cross,” said a forensic investigator.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Shroud of Turin, long considered by some to be the burial cloth of Jesus, has inconsistent bloodstain patterns that suggest it is a fake, a new forensic investigation has found. Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud bears an image of a crucified man. It has been analyzed for decades, to some controversy, with radiocarbon dating determining its origin to be between 1260 and 1390. It is regarded by the Vatican as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic. More than 2 million people came to see the shroud during a three-month display in 2015, including Pope Francis. The bloodstain pattern investigation reported on Tuesday by the Journal of Forensic Sciences is the first such analysis of the cloth, looking at its purported blood splatters and their alignment to each other in a kind of crime scene analysis. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. “This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,” Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News. “Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borrini conducted the analysis with chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the University of Pavia in Italy, using real and synthetic blood samples on cloth to test the orientation of stains on the better-defined left side of the cloth (they also compared the two liquids to see if they flowed the same way). They hoped to answer a debate over whether the crucifixion depicted on the cloth was T-shaped, Y-shaped, or some other manner of ancient Roman execution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, they found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. If it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” In the analysis, the two researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric: the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, along with a belt of blood (whether it is actually blood or paint pigments is another disputed forensic question) at the waist. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud, they could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen. They discovered the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part: The forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.

            "The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man. But a new study reported in the Journal of Forensic Sciences finds the bloodstain image was likely faked. Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

        "origin_prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nThe Unabomber thought so highly of his environmental manifesto that he threatened to keep killing if the New York Times and Washington Post didn't publish it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But 15 years after he was arrested at his remote cabin outside Lincoln, Mont., his twisted words seem to be worth less than his ratty sweatshirt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Marshall's office is currently holding an online auction of the personal effects of Ted Kaczynski, who, between 1978 and 1995, engaged in a mail bombing spree, killing three people and injuring 23 others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 68-year-old terrorist is currently serving a life sentence at a federal prison in Florence, Colo. The auction of his belongings ends June 2 and all the money raised will be used to pay off a $15 million restitution order to his victims and their families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Kaczynski's actions were designed to protest modern society's \"industrial-technological system,\" there aren't nearly enough possessions on the auction block to raise $15 million, especially because his most valuable possession -- the cabin he built in the Montana wilderness -- is now on display in the Washington, D.C. Newseum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, at least two items are getting some serious bids: His 35,000 word handwritten manifesto currently has a bid of $17,525, while the iconic hoodie made famous by the artistic rendering in the FBI's \"Wanted\" poster is up to $20,025 -- though for that price, the successful bidder will also receive a pair of sunglasses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another item attracting interest is Kaczynski's Smith-Corona typewriter. Bids for that are currently around the $11,000 mark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story continues below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other items have attracted less attention. The top bid for a hand-bowed wood saw that Kaczynski used is currently only $310, while handwritten letters to his Aunt Frida are only getting bids around $250. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, some people might say it's a sad sign of the times that the auction is even taking place, and you won't get an argument from art historian and appraiser Elyse Luray, who is best known for her work on the PBS series \"History Detectives.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she still believes there is value to be found in the auction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I hate to say it, but there is some collectibility in this auction,\" Luray told AOL Weird News. \"This is one of the most tragic events in U.S. history and the manifesto has historical value as does the typewriter that he used to type his two manifestos. You have to take the emotion out of it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luray dismisses most of what is being sold, figuring it is only going to be of value to \"some weird who wants something belonging to the Unabomber.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, she can see why something as mundane as Kaczynski's hand saw might be selling for much more than its actually worth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Hype increases value,\" she said. \"On the other hand, things like Marilyn Monroe's dresses or Liz Taylor's jewelry will retain value over the years.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, crime memorabilia collectors like Scott Michaels think there is a lot of value in being able to tell friends and neighbors that the saw they are borrowing was once used by the Unabomber. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michaels is the proprietor of Dearly Departed Tours, a company that shows crime aficionados visiting Los Angeles all the city's most infamous crime-oriented sights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Michaels is also a collector who has in his possession some extraordinary pieces of macabre memorabilia, including a piece of John Denver's plane, a hunk of the Hindenberg, and a tile from the swimming pool where Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones drowned. He also owns a clown painting made by serial killer John Wayne Gacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michaels makes no bones about his hobby (unless, of course, he chooses to buy one for his collection), but admits he often has to defend it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is history I choose to embrace,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I don't understand why people collect coins. You know, this is more common than people want to admit. Take a look at Dealey Plaza in Dallas. The people that are going there are basically there to see where JFK was shot.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From an objective viewpoint, he can see the value in the Unabomber's hoodie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That hoodie is iconic,\" he said. \"It really is the 'tah-dah' item, but the documents are interesting too.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet if he were to bid on an item himself, Michaels knows which one he'd choose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'd gravitate towards the saw,\" Michaels said. \"I like the human touch, knowing that he probably used it. I remember when they were doing a Marilyn Monroe auction. I never could have afforded the dresses, but I did purchase some golf course pencils that were stuck in her junk drawer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sadly, Michaels doesn't have the room in his house to hold his entire collection. Much of it is in storage, where it will remain until he is able to open an office-slash-museum large enough for his creepy collectibles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the market for crime memorabilia might seem to be new, criminologist Jeffery Ian Ross Ph.D. says it's been going on for a few hundred years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Ever since the invention of the printing press, the public hase been fascinated by crime,\" Ross said. \"I think the reason that the memorabilia has a certain appeal is partially motivated by boredom and voyeurism and a desire to have a connection with what's going on in the news.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the way, if you're thinking of jumping in on the auction at the last minute hoping to get rich off the Unabomber's memorabilia, Michaels has one word of advice: Don't! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I couldn't imagine buying any of this in order to make money,\" he said. \"This is more about having something that you find interesting to own. It's kind of fun to say, 'Hey, Jeffrey Dahmer used to own that video cassette of 'Exorcist III.'\"\nPassage 2:\nBehind all the muscle and good looks that make up Twilight beefcake Kellan Lutz, there’s a mushy charitable soul who’s doing his part along with a bunch of fellow celebs by auctioning off some luggage for a good cause.

On his contribution, Lutz says he was happy to take part: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It feels like I live on planes, so when JetBlue approached me to be part of this charity auction I jumped at the chance – it’s not every day someone offers to take your baggage off your hands.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nDavis discloses terminating pregnancy in her memoir NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AUSTIN - Sen. Wendy Davis, in her memoir due out next week, discloses the most personal of stories preceding her nationally marked fight against tighter abortion restrictions: a decision she and her then-husband made 17 years ago to end a much-wanted pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book, “Forgetting to Be Afraid,” goes on sale to the general public Tuesday. Copies will be available Monday at a Fort Worth book signing by Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis, in a copy of the book obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, wrote that her unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. She said doctors told her the syndrome would cause the baby to suffer and likely was incompatible with life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After getting several medical opinions and feeling the baby they had named Tate Elise “tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her” in the womb, she said the decision was clear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She was suffering,” Davis wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unborn baby's heart was “quieted” by her doctor, and their baby was gone. She was delivered by cesarean section in spring 1997, the memoir says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis wrote that she and her then-husband, Jeff, spent time with Tate the next day and had her baptized. They cried, took photographs and said their good-byes, she wrote, and Tate's lifeless body was taken away the following day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “An indescribable blackness followed. It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface. ... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed,” Davis wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 304-page hardcover is priced at $27.97 from Blue Rider Press, and imprint of the Penguin Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote: “Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abortion rights have been a major undercurrent in the race for governor between the Fort Worth Democrat and Abbott, a staunch abortion opponent. He has indicated he opposes the procedure even for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, saying, “We shouldn't discriminate against a child.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Abbott campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her memoir is being published as she trails in the polls behind Abbott, who is favored at a time when Democrats haven't elected anyone to statewide office in two decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said he doesn't expect the revelation to lose any votes for Davis, since he said it's a relative small proportion of voters who oppose abortion in cases of severe fetal abnormality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The group that will be most bothered by her having an abortion of a baby with a severe fetal abnormality is a group that wasn't going to vote for her anyway,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The positive side of it for her is it humanizes her, and also makes it a little tricky for opponents to attack her on the abortion issue because now, it not only is a political issue for her, but it's a personal issue,” Jones said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis launched her campaign last year after rising to national prominence with her fight against tighter abortion restrictions through a filibuster in which she shared women's personal stories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her pregnancy with Tate hasn't come up in the race, although she wrote that she considered talking about it during the filibuster when she read the story of a woman that was wrenchingly close to her own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That woman said the legislation's ban on abortion at 20 weeks would have prevented her choice on how best to proceed when her unborn baby was diagnosed with a terminal condition. Davis said she almost shared her story of Tate then, but she felt it would overshadow the day's events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis has previously disclosed the termination of another pregnancy, a medical necessity because the egg was implanted in her fallopian tube. That ectopic pregnancy wasn't sustainable, and her doctor advised her it would be dangerous to her health to continue because it would risk rupturing her tube, she said in her memoir. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis wrote that the ending of the ectopic pregnancy “is technically considered an abortion,” and that that she also was “heartbroken” over that loss. She said she believed that she was carrying a boy, whom she and Jeff already referred to as “Baby Lucas.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her campaign, Davis has largely couched the abortion issue in terms of women's access to health care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story of her pregnancy with Tate, however, is a key part of her memoir. The book's dedication begins, “For my daughters, Amber and Dru and Tate, who taught me a love deeper than I believed was possible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amber is her daughter from her first marriage and Dru, from her second, to Jeff Davis, a former City Council member. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book also is dedicated to Davis' parents, whose tumultuous relationship is detailed in the book, along with that volatility's tough impact on their children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis previously has talked about the financial strain when her father left the family and pursued his dream of a career in theater, but the book includes sometimes stark detail about those times and other parts of her life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, Davis said, her mother put her three young children in the trunk of her car in the garage, intending to get in the car herself and start the engine. She told Davis years later that she didn't want to live without her husband and didn't want to leave her children behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A neighbor dropped by and ended up praying with her, getting her past the dark spot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I've long believed in angels on earth, in a higher power, in moments when someone or something comes into your life out of the blue and saves you from the dangerous path you're on. Like that one,” Davis said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis more than once cites “angels” and talks about her faith in God in the memoir as she outlines her life story, which has come under a microscope because of its importance to her narrative in the governor's race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The memoir adds layers of detail to her story of a hardscrabble life after her father left their family; her struggles to pay the bills as a young mother after her first marriage ended; and community college as the first step on an upward path including graduation from Harvard Law School and service on the Fort Worth City Council and in the state Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis previously has faced questions for suggesting she was a teen-age single mom (her first divorce wasn't final until she was 21, although she separated earlier) and for her lack of emphasis on her second husband's role in her journey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She has long cited the essential truth of her story, and the memoir includes specifics. She credits Jeff as her partner and mentor, while maintaining she would have gone through law school even without him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis also writes extensively about her relationship with her first husband and her family, including her sympathy for her mother, the stalwart caregiver, and her father, who left the family in tough financial straits when they divorced and he pursed his dream of community theater — but whom she describes as “magic,” the parent who let her know she was loved. He died last year, before she announced for governor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis ends the book with a story of a time she felt Tate said good-bye to her, when she and her husband and friends were on a golf course and Davis was caught in a cylindrical swirl of leaves, lifted by the wind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And I felt her. I was sure of it. Tate. Moving through me, saying her good-byes to me. Letting me go,” Davis wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR pfikac@express-news.net\nPassage 2:\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, who became a national political sensation by filibustering her state's tough new restrictions on abortion, discloses in her upcoming memoir that she had an abortion in the 1990s after discovering that the fetus had a severe brain abnormality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE - In this Aug. 26, 2014, file photo, Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis presents her new education policy during a stop at Palo Alto College in San Antonio. Davis reveals in a new... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In \"Forgetting to be Afraid,\" Davis also writes about ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus. Davis says she considered revealing the terminated pregnancies during her nearly 13-hour speech on the floor of the Texas Senate last summer — but decided against it, saying \"such an unexpected and dramatically personal confession would overshadow the events of the day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Associated Press purchased an early copy of the book, which goes on sale Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both pregnancies happened before Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, began her political career and after she was already a mother to two young girls. Davis catapulted to national Democratic stardom after her filibuster temporarily delayed passed of sweeping new abortion restrictions. She's now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second pregnancy happened in 1996. Davis writes that during her second trimester she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. But a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, Davis says. She sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery, she writes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I could feel her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do,\" Davis writes. \"She was suffering.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She goes on to say that an \"indescribable blackness followed\" the pregnancy and that the loss left her forever changed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and terminating it was considered medically necessary, Davis writes. Such pregnancies generally aren't considered viable, meaning the fetus can't survive, and they can endanger the mother's life. But Davis writes that in Texas, it's \"technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis' filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it online, with President Barack Obama at one point tweeting, \"Something special is happening in Austin tonight.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the book, Davis recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. She says the story could have been hers and writes about her hands shaking and wiping tears from her eyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis' filibuster only temporarily delayed the restrictions, which passed overwhelmingly when Perry called a special legislative session. The measure requires doctors who perform abortion to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandates that clinics upgrade its facilities to hospital-level operating standards. A federal judge in Austin last month blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anti-abortion groups, including those that have attacked Davis' candidacy, expressed sympathy for the tough choice Davis confronted with the second terminated pregnancy but said they hoped all decisions end in choosing to continue a pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's an incredibly difficult position for anyone to find themselves in. While our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,\" Texans Right to Life spokeswoman Melissa Conway said Friday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch did not return messages seeking comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood and the daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards praised Davis' \"unwavering courage\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are grateful to her for sharing her story and shining a light on a subject that is too often hidden in the shadows of shame and stigma by people like Greg Abbott and his allies,\" Richards said.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:\n",

            "Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' new memoir is dedicated in part to daughters Amber, Dru, and Tate, and those familiar with Davis' life story might be puzzled by the last name on that list. That's because Davis is revealing for the first time that Tate is the unborn child that she and her husband aborted in the second trimester, after doctors discovered a severe brain abnormality. The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized. After the abortion, \"an indescribable blackness followed,\" writes Davis in Forgetting to Be Afraid, \"and when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person.\" Davis also writes of a previously disclosed procedure to terminate an earlier ectopic pregnancy in which the embryo was implanted outside the uterus. She says she opted not to talk about either case during her famous filibuster because she feared it would \"overshadow the events of the day.\""

Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to call Pittsfield Police Officer Brenna Dorr at 413-448-9700, ext 384. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PITTSFIELD — Two men are facing charges for allegedly participating in a citywide prostitution ring involving multiple women — one of whom may have been as young as 15 — who were allegedly plied with drugs and threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph E. Van Wert, 65, of Becket, and Randy W. Lambach, 45, of Pittsfield, are being held on charges including human trafficking pending dangerousness hearing Nov. 29 to determine if bail should be set and in what amount. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation began in the spring of 2017 after police began receiving calls and complaints regarding apparent increases in prostitution throughout the city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the activity seemed to be centered around the areas of First, Adam, North, Linden and Wahconah streets, police said. Many of the women had been recruited by a white male named \"Randy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Randy would seek out women with a drug addiction, photograph them and post advertisements online, seeking clients for sexual services, police were told. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While conducting patrols around First and Second streets, police interviewed multiple women, many of whom admitted to being prostitutes, but declined to identify who \"tricked them out.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One told police she didn't \"street-walk,\" but instead got her \"dates\" through ads on backpage.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police also began receiving reports of suspected prostitution from a North Street senior living facility, where Randy had driven at least five women to and from Van Wert's third-floor apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police were provided the plate number of the blue station wagon used to shuttle the women and identified Lambach as its owner. And witnesses identified Lambach via photographs as the man they knew as Randy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One woman told police she was prostituted by Lambach for about a year and had sex with him for money or to pay off a debt on multiple occasions. Lambach photographed her and placed advertisements on backpage.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Men would contact Lambach via cellphone and a date, time, location and fee would be agreed upon. Rates were typically $80 for 30 minutes or between $160 and $200 for an hour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lambach would then contact the woman and drive her to the appointment, police said. He would sometimes wait outside or watch from a closet or doorway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He would collect the money and keep anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of it. Sometimes he would keep all of the money and pay the woman with a few bags of heroin or some crack cocaine instead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the women told police Lambach would drive her to appointments outside of Pittsfield, and on at least one occasion, outside of the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He allegedly recruited and transported about 10 other women in a similar manner and provided narcotics to those that used drugs to get them high before having sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lambach allegedly threatened to turn the women in if they stopped working for him, and warned them the police would not believe them because they were, \"drug addicts and whores.\" Police were told some of the women Lambach had recruited used to be his foster children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He would host meetings between women and customers at Van Wert's apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Van Wert allegedly paid for sex with the women and was paid by Lambach in cash and drugs for use of his apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another witness told police that Lambach approached her in August, telling her he ran a prostitution ring and showed her several photographs of women he said worked for him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That witness said it appeared several of the women in those photos were very young and estimated the age of one at about 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lambach allegedly said he also drives women to Springfield, where they prostitute themselves from a strip club. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another witness told police Lambach may have been involved in prostitution and trafficking for about 10 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other witnesses told police Lambach would threaten the women if he thought they were giving information to the police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By mid-November, police felt they had enough probable cause to arrest the men. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lambach was picked up without incident about 4 p.m. Nov. 14. Van Wert was arrested at his apartment shortly thereafter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lambach has pleaded not guilty in Central Berkshire District Court to four counts of human trafficking. Van Wert has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit human trafficking, deriving support from prostitution, maintaining a house of prostitution and sexual conduct for a fee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation remains ongoing and additional charges may be coming.

            "Two men have been charged with human trafficking after police arrested them for running a prostitution ring out of a senior living facility in Pittsfield, Mass. Police say Joseph Van Wert, 65, and Randy Lambach, 45, will face a hearing later this month, the New York Daily News reports. Lambach would allegedly seek out women with drug addictions and post their pictures online, then arrange meetings with clients. Some of these meetings took place in Van Wert's apartment in a senior facility. Van Wert offered his apartment in return for cash or drugs. The Berkshire Eagle reports that the police investigation began last spring in response to citizen complaints about increased prostitution across the city. Lambach would allegedly keep up to 90% of the money the women made, sometimes refusing them cash altogether and paying them in heroin or crack cocaine instead. At least one woman said Lambach drove her to an \"appointment\" across state lines. Police estimated one of the victims was 15 years old. They were also told that some of the women were Lambach's former foster children. Both men have pleaded not guilty, Lambach to four counts of human trafficking and Van Wert to conspiracy to commit human trafficking, deriving support from prostitution, maintaining a house of prostitution, and sexual conduct for a fee."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she claimed he never carried out the threat at the time because of his love for her and insisted he had dumped the gun he was going to use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet as soon as news came through that Lennon had been killed, Gloria said she knew Chapman was the assassin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now she is hoping that after 38 years behind bars, her husband may soon be free as he faces a parole hearing for the 10th time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria, 67, said: “It didn’t matter how long Mark was in prison. I would wait for him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Jeff Rayner/Coleman-Rayner) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Getty) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She has had to wait nearly four decades so far, after Chapman, 63, was given 20 years to life for murdering Lennon on December 8, 1980. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she told how she has still been allowed to have sex with him during prison visits in a caravan on the grounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria was 5,000 miles away at home in Kailua, Hawaii, when the devastating news came in that the 40-year-old was dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said: “I knew it was Mark. How did I know? Two months earlier, Mark had travelled to New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He came home scared, telling me that to make a name for himself he had planned to kill Lennon. But he said my love had saved him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Getty) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria knew ­Chapman was ­planning to return to New York but she had no idea he was on a murder mission for real this time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: “The only reason I was OK with Mark making another trip was because I had believed him when he said he needed to grow up as an adult and husband, and needed time to think about his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He wanted me to sacrifice being alone for a short time so that we could have a long, happy marriage together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He said he threw the gun into the ocean, and I believed him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But he had lied to me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along with music fans across the world, Gloria was stunned when reports of Lennon’s death flashed across screens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Reuters) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said: “December 8, 1980, was one of the darkest nights of my life. I remember it was a Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I had come home from work, fixed dinner, and was watching Little House on the Prairie. On the show, Mary had just found out she’d become blind when suddenly, words ran across the bottom of the screen: ‘John Lennon has been shot in New York City by a male Caucasian.’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “My life changed dramatically that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was now Mrs Mark David Chapman, the wife of a murderer and not just any murderer but one whose victim was known and loved by millions around the world.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Getty) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After her husband was arrested, Gloria’s friends urged her to divorce him. The killer himself even told her to leave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, by now deeply religious, she refused, citing the vows they exchanged when married on June 2, 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking through her church, former travel agent Gloria said: “I admit when I got lonely and depressed in that first year of being apart from him, I thought maybe divorce was the right thing to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Ultimately, I prayed and searched the Bible to read what God says about divorce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Finally, in the book of Malachi, I read, ‘I hate divorce,’ says the Lord God of Israel.’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That settled it, and I closed my Bible. From that point on, I decided I would wait for Mark.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Andy Johnstone for The Daily Mirror) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria’s devotion to killer Chapman comes despite admitting she was violently abused during their one year of marriage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And he cut her off entirely for a year, while not allowing her to see him in jail for almost four. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple met in early 1978 in Hawaii. She was 26 and, like Chapman, dedicated her life to the church and hospitals. He was 22 and a ­maintenance worker at Castle Medical Center in Kailua. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A year earlier he had travelled to Hawaii on a one-way ticket before trying to gas himself inside his car. But the vacuum cleaner hose he had used melted in the exhaust and the attempt failed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chapman was admitted to the hospital where he worked, but made what his psychiatrist and the unit’s staff perceived as a rapid recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria told how their love grew after that first meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: New York Daily News) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said: “As I was a travel agent, he wanted my help to plan a vacation around the world. My love for Mark began and grew with each postcard I received. When Mark returned to Hawaii I met him at the airport. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We started dating the following night. By the end of that year, Mark and I felt as though we had known each other for ever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We talked about everything, including his mental illness and how he had come to Hawaii to kill himself and ended up at a local hospital’s psychiatric ward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He explained that he had gotten well enough to get a job at the hospital as a housekeeper. It seemed to me his mental illness was behind him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Splash News) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Gloria said her husband soon started to change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to The Alliance, a ­“Christian-centred global movement”, she added: “First, Mark lost his new job at the hospital after a run-in with a nursing supervisor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He got angry with me more easily, and on a couple of occasions he hurt me physically. He started drinking and came home drunk. But I took our vows seriously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I said I will love Mark ‘for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, in ­sickness, and in health, so long as we both shall live.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the past 25 years, Gloria and Chapman have only been allowed to spend 44 hours each year together during conjugal visits, holed up in the caravan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said they spend their time making pizzas, watching Wheel of Fortune on TV and making love. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chapman’s parole hearing is due to be held the week starting August 20. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Daily Mirror) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Gloria hopes, despite ­objections from Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, her wait to have him home is a few weeks from ending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recently, the New York State parole board has been more willing to place heavier emphasis on an inmate’s ­behaviour behind bars than focus on the severity of the crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result, several police killers and other ­notorious murderers who had been long denied parole have been set free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria has been praying for Chapman’s release. He was denied freedom at the last hearing in 2016 after officials said he would reoffend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But they commended his ­“acceptance” that his crime was “premeditated and evil”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Chapman has told his wife to have faith in his freedom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria said: “Mark often says, ‘All I need is Jesus.’ And it’s true.”\nPassage 2:\nThese crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

            "The man who murdered John Lennon will remain behind bars after his 10th unsuccessful parole hearing, reports the Daily News. Mark David Chapman, now 63, was turned down again this week. No reasons have yet been made public, but the newspaper reports that Yoko Ono sent the parole board a letter asking that Chapman remain in the Wende Correctional Facility in upstate New York—not only for the safety of her and her family, but for his own safety. Chapman, who shot Lennon in New York City in 1980, is up again for parole in about two years. Chapman's wife recently told the UK Mirror that he talked of killing Lennon two months before actually doing so."

Simpson that for a little while filled TV screens across America on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Nevada parole board decided Simpson should be freed after the former NFL star apologized for his role in a 2007 armed robbery, said he'd been a model prisoner, and promised that he'd have no conflicts if released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson's appearance before the board garnered wall-to-wall coverage from cable news shows, coverage that recalled the \"trial of the century,\" and the many months more than 20 years ago when it transfixed a nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I've done my time,\" Simpson said. \"I've done it as well and as respectfully as I think anyone can.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now 70, Simpson's energy seemed little affected by his time behind bars. He was alert, engaged, and quick to smile, even letting out a hearty laugh when parole board Chairman Connie Bisbee accidentally said he was aged 90. \"I feel like it,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson has served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. He is expected to be released as early as October -- and said he plans to move to his home in Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An entire generation of Americans has come of age since Simpson seemed an almost inescapable public figure. But for one afternoon, it felt like 1995 again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was the year he was acquitted of murder charges in the grisly slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's parole hearing followed renewed interest in his story, which was explored last year in the award-winning documentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" and the FX true-crime drama \"The People v. O.J. Simpson.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though it's been 22 years since the not guilty verdict, the murder trial's themes of criminal justice and race, trust in police, celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture. \"We talk about O.J. as though the story is O.J.,\" journalist Celia Farber says toward the end of the \"Made in America\" documentary. \"The story is O.J. and us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parole board vote unanimous NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For his part, Simpson seemed remarkably unaltered. He repeatedly avoided taking full responsibility for the Vegas crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, he said he had lived a \"conflict-free life,\" a statement that perhaps bemused anyone whose memory stretches back more than two decades.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of those associates is Tom Riccio. Simpson testified that Riccio is the one who called him, persuading him to take part in the robbery. Simpson said Thursday he regretted ever taking Riccio's call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, according to Riccio, Simpson did a lot more than that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He should wish he didn't make all those calls after my call,\" Riccio told CNN. \"After he took my call he did a lot of things he shouldn't have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riccio added that Simpson was the one who orchestrated the robbery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He plotted it all and gathered up men with guns.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson said Riccio avoided punishment by throwing him under the bus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, they got a get-out-of-jail-free card when they said 'O.J. told me (to do it),'\" Simpson said. \"Nothing I can do about that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sufficient remorse is not a relevant factor for parole, and Simpson ticked off several mitigating factors that made him a good candidate for release. He was discipline-free in prison, he has stable release plans, he has family and community support -- and, of course, he has no prior criminal convictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The four parole board members voted unanimously to grant him parole, and board member Tony Corda said he was graded a \"low risk to reoffend.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson smiled, said \"thank you,\" and then put his head down for a few moments silently.

            "OJ Simpson's big moment has arrived. A hearing is underway at which he is trying to convince members of the Nevada Board of Parole that he should go free. \"I haven't made any excuses in the nine years that I've been here and I'm not trying to make an excuse now,\" said the 70-year-old Simpson early in the proceedings, per the AP. Later, he added, \"I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\" He also appeared to stifle a sob in his appeal to the board. Simpson has been imprisoned since 2008 over an armed robbery and kidnapping case, but he and many legal analysts think that the board will vote to release him. If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other Simpson quotes: \"I'm at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend as much time with my children.\" \"I've basically spent a conflict-free life.\" Daughter Arnelle Simpson said her father is \"remorseful,\" and she wants him to come home so they can \"move forward,\" adding, \"It's been hard.\""

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE - In this May 24, 2010 file photo, Dave Price, center, performs with Backstreet Boys Howie Dorough and Brian Littrell on CBS News' \"The Early Show\" in New York. CBS News is completely overhauling... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The network is also replacing weather forecaster Dave Price with Marysol Castro, formerly of ABC's \"Good Morning America\" weekend edition, and adding Jeff Glor as the regular news reader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new team will start Jan. 3. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There had been little inkling that alterations were afoot, although the show had changed its executive producer, David Friedman, within the past year. Friedman said he believed the new team had the right energy and chemistry to embark on another effort at lifting the show out of third place in the network morning news ratings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's less about what we weren't getting and less about a generational change or a different direction,\" Friedman said. \"We just literally think this is the right team going forward.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Early Show\" has consistently ranked behind the morning champ, NBC's \"Today\" show, and ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" The week before Thanksgiving was typical. \"Today\" averaged 5.6 million viewers each day, \"GMA\" had 4.6 million and \"The Early Show\" had 2.9 million, the Nielsen Co. said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News President Sean McManus said he won't be expecting any immediate ratings changes in a time where \"Today\" hasn't lost a single week in nearly 15 years. But he said he believed the new team will help the show grow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This group, I think, will work very well together,\" McManus said. \"I think the chemistry will be very good.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We just felt the timing was right to start planning for the future,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith had the longest tenure on \"The Early Show.\" He was the sole survivor from 2002 when CBS installed a four-anchor team that included Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen and Rene Syler. Chen still contributes occasional reports to the show; the others have left CBS News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith also hosted a previous CBS morning show from 1987 to 1996. CBS said he'll stay at the network as a news reporter and primary substitute at the \"CBS Evening News,\" \"Face the Nation\" and \"Sunday Morning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alerted that changes were coming, Smith said he took a \"long walk on a cold golf course\" Sunday and reflected on doing the CBS morning show for 17 of the last 25 years. \"To be honest, I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities I've had,\" he said, confirming that he plans to stay at CBS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have given them everything I can possibly give,\" said Smith, 59. \"I wish the people who follow nothing but the best. God love 'em, I hope they can move the (ratings) needle more.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wragge worked in sports, including a stint as a sideline reporter at events for NBC, until he made the jump to news in 2006. Beside his weekend job at CBS, he had been anchoring local news broadcasts at the network's New York affiliate, a job he'll give up to go national. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hill, who came to CBS from CNN, briefly filled in for Rodriguez last year when Rodriguez was on maternity leave. She's the only holdover from the current daily program, although in a different role. Currently, she reads the newscasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wragge and Hill's growth as a team has been evident on Saturday mornings, and they've proven adept at shifting between hard news and lighter fare, McManus said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They're uniquely suited to each other and to the morning show genre,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friedman said it's an advantage for CBS that its regular viewers know each of the new personalities, except for weather forecaster Castro. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're not introducing somebody to the morning genre that has never been in the morning genre,\" he said. \"That is a little bit tougher.\" That's likely a reference to the other recent morning transition, where George Stephanopoulos replaced Diane Sawyer as a co-host at \"Good Morning America\" late last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's hard to fault CBS for looking to shake things up,\" said David Bianculli, a veteran television critic and now a media professor at Rowan University in New Jersey. \"I have a lot of respect for Harry Smith, but for a long time, this has not been working on a daily basis.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suddenness of the \"bloodbath\" was surprising, Bianculli said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Anything that's done this quickly smells of desperation,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News said it is discussing future roles at the network with Rodriquez and Price. Price has filmed human interest reports along with doing the weather on \"The Early Show.\" Earlier this month, producers dropped him off in Alaska with only $50 and a phone and challenged him to earn his way back to New York City.

            "Modern Family star Ariel Winter has words for those who criticized the gold minidress she wore to an event for the show Wednesday night, People reports. Photos from the screening of the season eight finale showed that Winter's outfit stood out among the clothes worn by the other cast members who attended (Julie Bowen, for example, wore black slacks with a simple top, while Ty Burrell showed up in jeans). USA Today describes Winter's outfit like so: \"Mesh panels showed off her cleavage as well as the tops of her thighs.\" But some of the commentary on Winter's outfit went beyond simply calling the teen overdressed, with some going so far as to say she looked \"slutty.\" On Thursday night, Winter responded on Instagram. \"Why TF does anyone care that I didn't dress casual like everyone else for the panel? Why do I have to be like everyone else? Why can’t people just let other people feel good about themselves and do what they want?\" the 19-year-old wrote. \"WEAR WHATEVER YOU WANT PEOPLE! As long as you feel good about yourself that’s what matters. I know I did. Don’t ever let anyone stifle who you are and how you express yourself. Rant over.\" (Winter says her \"baby voice\" makes her boyfriend uncomfortable.)"

            "Police in the country's smallest state capital are investigating something that hasn't happened there in living memory: a murder. Police in Vermont say they have issued an arrest warrant for 29-year-old Jayveon Caballero, who is accused of fatally shooting Markus Austin in Montpelier early Sunday after an altercation, the Times Argus reports. Witnesses told investigators that Austin, 33, assaulted Caballero’s girlfriend, Desiree Cary, during the altercation outside a bar in the nearby city of Barre early Sunday. Police say Caballero later confronted Austin outside his apartment and shot him dead. The body was found in the parking lot of Austin's apartment complex. A Vermont State Police spokesman says Caballero, who knew Austin before the shooting, fled the town and probably the state after the shooting, WCAX reports. The police spokesman says Caballero is believed to have boarded a Greyhound bus bound for New York City on Sunday morning, which made numerous stops in other states along the way. Later Sunday, Cary, 22, was arrested on apparently unrelated charges of selling heroin and crack cocaine. With around 7,500 residents, Montpelier has the smallest population of any state capital, the AP notes. Police Chief Anthony Facos says this is the city's first murder since a woman shot her husband in the 1920s."
