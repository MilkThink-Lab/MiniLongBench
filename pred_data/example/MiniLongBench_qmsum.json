Let's try this . Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Whoo .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um . Mm-hmm . Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh not . Oh . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Okay . Yeah . No problem .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Shit happens . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: A parrot . Ish .\nMarketing: Wow . Oh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: He did it before .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No , no . Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Nice .\nProject Manager: Very good .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nUser Interface: Uh blank .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . {gap} So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . So {vocalsound} now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I will start .\nProject Manager: F first {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh g big buttons , {vocalsound} m uh that's easier to use than uh {disfmarker} I think . Not all the small buttons , you don't know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?\nIndustrial Designer: Big buttons , positive .\nProject Manager: Positive .\nIndustrial Designer: All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for .\nProject Manager: Okay . What are your experiences ?\nUser Interface: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: And that it controls the channels and the the volume . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it {disfmarker} in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So and do they always have that ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} No no no . But I {disfmarker} my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that .\nProject Manager: It's easy to you .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . 'Kay .\nMarketing: Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Thank you .\nMarketing: That's not really ea easy .\nIndustrial Designer: Help also . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nMarketing: So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v {vocalsound} not easy to use . So we n barely used it .\nProject Manager: Okay so they have too much . So next .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nProject Manager: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: The weight . Not not too heavy .\nProject Manager: Not too heavy . Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Not much buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some {gap} {disfmarker} uh some sort of bleep .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Like a phone .\nIndustrial Designer: And then you uh , hey there there's remote control .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Next .\nProject Manager: that's {gap} .\nUser Interface: Yeah well that's {disfmarker} that are good ideas . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah I think it uh {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .\nProject Manager: Okay . This is {disfmarker} It has to be compatible with other things .\nMarketing: Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: I have one more idea . Just popped up .\nProject Manager: Yes ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't {disfmarker} won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .\nProject Manager: No battery use . So more ideas ?\nUser Interface: Mm no .\nProject Manager: No okay . It's only the first ideas . So {vocalsound} uh what are we going to do now is {disfmarker} Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do . Well look on your {gap} . And {disfmarker} Next instructions you'll get in your email . So {disfmarker} This is the first meeting . See you later in half an hour .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Thank you .\nMarketing: Okay .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What's the decision of remote feature design?\nAnswer:",

            "Project Manager believed that it could not be heavy. Industrial Designer indicated that fewer and bigger buttons are better and should be bust-free, for instance, rubber could be used on it. Industrial Designer also suggested that when users push a button, they could hear some sort of bleep. User Interface suggested a LED on the corner and not too expensive material like plastic could be used. Marketing added that it should look nice for better sales and should work with as many as possible of existing products listed on their website. Industrial Designer also concluded that it should be battery-saving."

        "origin_prompt": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nThe Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call the meeting to order. Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. We will proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements. That's confirmed. We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Once the petition is presented, the member is asked to bring it here to the Table. Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition.\nMr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith. They're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals. They want us to follow the European Union model, under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned. Moving forward, they're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada.\nThe Chair: Mr. Poilievre is next.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I rise today to table e-petition 2466, initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville, a beautiful west Ottawa community. The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory. It was collected by Cara, a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy. Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport, Ontario. Joshua was not wearing a life jacket. Worse, Cara's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua's body. Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2, 3, and 4 of the regulations. I support Cara's efforts, and I'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf.\nThe Chair: Seeing no further petitions to be presented, we'll continue, and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Go ahead, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): It was revealed yesterday that this government's policy was to ignore fraud. The Prime Minister's reaction was to act as if everything was normal. In fact, we've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications. The Prime Minister is failing our future generations. Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he's borrowing to pay tax cheats. Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it, and that's exactly what we've done. Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed. Having said that, I want to make it very clear, Mr.Chair: Fraud is unacceptable. We have measures in place to detect fraud. All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government. We're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it, and no one is arguing that they shouldn't, but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud. It's a simple question: Yes or no, did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible, but of course fraud is unacceptable. That's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: It's a yes-or-no question, Mr. Chair. Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases, yes or no?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible. We have put measures in place to detect fraud. People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it is clear that he can't answer a yes-or-no question, so we can all assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people. It's letting so many Canadians down. Small business owners who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports. Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them. Does the Prime Minister think it's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no, while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation, one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we did. We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and, as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, when these programs were first designed, the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later. Well, here we are in May, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons. Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who don't happen to have a business bank account, who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify, or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians. That was the priority, and that's what we've been doing for the past two months. As we've said, we will continue to tweak and improve the programs to make sure that more people who need help will get it. We are working the best we can, as fast as we can, to help those millions of Canadians who need support.\nThe Chair: You have time for about a 15-second question, Mr. Scheer.\nHon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister indicated that he would support Taiwan's inclusion in the WHO only as a non-state observer. Of course, that designation does not exist. Participants of the WHO are either states or NGOs. Will the Prime Minister support Taiwan's participation as a state observer?\nThe Chair: The Right Honourable Prime Minister has 15 seconds or less, please.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we will continue with our one China policy, but we have always advocated Taiwan's meaningful inclusion in international bodies where it makes sense to do so, and that includes at the WHO.\nThe Chair: Mr.Blanchet now has the floor.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. On Friday, students in Quebec and Canada will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit, which is a good thing. This program was necessary, particularly because the number of students who won't be able to get back their jobs from last year is much higher than the number of jobs that might be available to these young people. There are also issues of duration. We don't know how long these jobs will remain unavailable. People talked about a risk to being in the labour market and meeting the needs of the labour market. On April29, the Deputy Prime Minister made a formal commitment to ensure that these programs are accompanied by work incentives for youth and all CESB recipients. So that everyone knows what they're getting into, I'd like to know whether the employment incentives that will accompany the Canada emergency response benefit will be known by Friday.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: I thank the hon. member for understanding the importance of supporting students who, for the most part, won't be able to get the summer jobs they were counting on. Young people don't just want to earn money; they also want to gain work experience. That's why we're setting up programs, including Canada summer jobs, but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors, so that young people can also get jobs. We will continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed, while ensuring that youth are well-supported.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: That's very interesting, but it doesn't answer my question at all. People in the fishing, tourism and agricultural sectors, as well as municipalities and, from the very beginning, of course, the Government of Quebec, more generally, have expressed fears that job gains will cause people to lose their benefits and discourage them from going to work. The only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money as they work more. That is the principle. In fact, we propose that over the $1,000no-penalty limit, half of the earnings be exempt from penalty. Is this something that could be considered? Since it's been two weeks since the commitment was made and it's urgent, can we act now? The emergency shouldn't last eight months.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, young people need money, but they also need work experience. This is an unprecedented situation, which is why we're working with seasonal industries and the different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation. Students can be part of it, but at the same time we must provide the necessary support for those who can't find a job. That's why we continue to work with the industries involved to ensure that they have a sufficient workforce while we support students.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Unfortunately, the spirit of it doesn't seem to have been understood. I doubt that, even in the best-case scenario, the government will be able to get all the jobs needed in a timely manner for all these young people to decide to go ahead. So, first of all, there will be a shortage of jobs. Second, people aren't crazy. If they earn less by working than they earn by not working, all the good faith in the world won't solve the problem. Can we make sure that people keep more money in their pockets as they work more? I think we can have a clear answer, given the timeframe. People are going to start registering for the program on Friday. The principles are good, but a clear answer would be good too.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Beginning Friday, students will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit. When they apply, they'll all be directed to a job bank that we've set up to make sure they know what jobs are available to get not only the money they need, but also the experience they need for their future, while helping our society in this crisis. I know we're going to be able to count on young people.\nThe Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Singh.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, one of the most devastating outcomes of this COVID-19 crisis has been the impact on seniors. Eighty per cent or more of the deaths during COVID-19 have been seniors living in long-term care homes. The military had to be called in. Out of 14 countries, Canada has been deemed the worst in its care of seniors. Despite all this, the Prime Minister has said recently that he doesn't feel it's the federal government's responsibility to find a solution. How can he say to families reeling with loss that it's not the federal government's responsibility to play a role in solving this problem?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, perhaps the fact that the NDP no longer has many seats in Quebec has caused it to forget the importance of respecting the Constitution and the areas of jurisdiction of provincial versus federal governments. We will be there to work with the provinces as they deal with challenges in their long-term care facilities. We are there as a partner, but we, on this side of the House, will always respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and be there to support them in fulfilling those responsibilities.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Everyone across Canada has just heard this Prime Minister double down on the idea that he doesn't feel it's his responsibility, despite the fact that the Canadian military had to go into long-term care homes. There is a role that the federal government can play. Both Liberal and Conservative federal governments have been consistently, for decades, cutting transfers to health care. They can increase those transfers to ensure long-term care is adequately funded. We could also ensure that there's a national care guarantee, working with provinces to ensure that we are meeting the best standards. We could increase workers' pay. We could ensure that there's no more profiting off the backs of seniors when it comes to long-term care. Will the Prime Minister commit to some of these care guarantees?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: It will come as exactly no surprise to the vast majority of Canadians that the Liberal Party will always stand up for the Constitution of Canada. We respect the Constitution. We respect areas of provincial jurisdiction. As I have said from the very beginning of this crisis, we will be there to help the provinces as they manage the challenges they're facing. The federal government does have a role to play, and it is a role to support the provinces in doing the things they need to do during this unprecedented time. We will continue to be there.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: I am glad to hear the Prime Minister is no longer trying to hide behind jurisdiction. We know that in long-term care homes, the for-profit long-term care homes have been the site of the worst conditions, where the greatest number of seniors have died. Will the Prime Minister join us in committing to remove profit from the long-term care system? Vulnerable seniors should not be subject to the profits of a company willing to cut services, staffing and quality of care instead of ensuring that seniors get the best care possible.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: I think it has become clear for all Canadians that we need to improve the care offered to our seniors right across the country. We cannot look at these numbers we are seeing and these tragedies hitting so many families and not want to see us as a country do better. That is why we of course recognize that we will work with other orders of government, particularly the provinces in whose jurisdiction this area rests primarily, to support answering these questions for the long term on how we improve the way Canada supports our elders. This is something really important that we will be there for.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: At the CHSLD Herron in Dorval, 31seniors died in one month. The residents were left without food, dehydrated and without care, and those with COVID-19 symptoms were not isolated from the others. Families pay between $3,000 and $10,000 a month for their loved ones to be at the centre. How can the Prime Minister think that he doesn't have a role to play in finding a solution to this devastating problem?\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, all Quebeckers and even all Canadians were stunned to learn of the tragedy at the Dorval CHSLD. We were very happy, as citizens, when the Government of Quebec reacted firmly and asked many questions in connection with this situation. We will support the Government of Quebec in its efforts to find answers and, most importantly, to ensure that, in the long term, the country will better support seniors in all regions.\nThe Chair: We'll continue with Mr.Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Mr. Chair, how many emergency response benefit cheques have been sent to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos (President of the Treasury Board): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I'd like to start by quickly saying that a total of 7.7million Canadians have received the Canada emergency response benefit, which is absolutely essential for\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: How many emergency response benefits have been sent out to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I see that the pace will allow me to give a little bit of information for each question. As we said at the outset, there will be mechanisms\nThe Chair: Mr.Poilievre has the floor.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: How many?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: We're working very hard.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: How many?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: We're working very hard to ensure the integrity of the mechanism while at the same time taking important steps to help Canadians.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: How many emergency response benefit cheques have been sent to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: A total of 7.7million Canadians have received the Canada emergency response benefit, and the agency is ensuring the integrity of the system.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: He's now claiming that it's all 7.7 million? That's crazy. The department is reported to have given out 200,000. Is 200,000 the correct number of cheques that have been sent out to people whose applications have been red-flagged as fraudulent, yes or no?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased to use the opportunity given to me by the hon. member to make the following clarifications. I thank him for it. First, approximately 7.7million Canadians have received at least one payment. Second, almost 11million payments have been made.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: How many prisoners have received a Canada emergency response benefit cheque?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: This allows me to go even further and thank the hon. member again. Some 7.7million Canadians have received emergency assistance in an emergency situation\nThe Chair: Mr.Poilievre has the floor.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: So now he's claiming that 7 million Canadians are in jail? The question was this: How many prisoners have received a benefit cheque?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, jokes can be made about the plight of Canadians who are suffering tremendously in this crisis, but I'm not here to make\nThe Chair: Mr.Poilievre has the floor.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Even the CBC is saying that prisoners are receiving the cheque. They can't have lost their jobs. They were already in prison. It's a simple question: How many prisoners have received the cheques?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I'd like to remind hon. members that we're talking about an extremely serious situation, a situation that has called into question people's ability to make ends meet, a situation that required emergency measures. We're going to continue to do the job that Canadians expect.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The question was, how many prisoners have received the cheques?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I've already explained to the hon. memberand I'm pleased to remind himthat this benefit is an emergency measure.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The Auditor General says that he's dropping half of his audits because the government refuses to provide him with funding. If the government has enough money to send 200,000 fraudulent applicants emergency cheques, why won't the government give the Auditor General the funding he requested?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I thank the hon. member. It gives me the opportunity, in this emergency situation, to talk about the role of institutions, including that of the Auditor General, which we will continue to support because it helps us do things right.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Then what does the Auditor General have to do to get the money to do his audits? Does he have to file a bunch of fraudulent applications for an emergency response benefit?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, because I know the hon. member well enough, I'm sure that he isn't givingand doesn't want to givethe impression that the Auditor General wants to commit fraud to do his job properly.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: I agree, and that's why he should get the money he needs to do his job. He did twice as many audits under the previous government as he is doing now, but he doesn't have the money to do the audits he needs to do to keep an eye on this government's extraordinary spending. Yes or no, will the government give the Auditor General the funding he has requested so he can get back to doing the same number of audits he did under the much more robust funding of the previous Harper government?\nThe Chair: The hon. Prime Minister.\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the previous government cut funding to the Auditor General and caused the office to lay off dozens of employees. We increased the funding for the Auditor General. We recognize the important work the Auditor General needs to do, and that's why we increased the funding for the Auditor General. The party of the member opposite cut this funding.\nThe Chair: I appreciate the help from some of the members in keeping time. I do have my own chronograph here, so I'll take care of it from this end, but I appreciate the help. Thank you. I now give the floor to Mr.Deltell.\nMr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC): Mr.Chair, I fully agree with the Treasury Board President that we aren't here to make jokes, but to set the record straight for Canadians. Yesterday, the National Post reported on the front page that 200,000people had fraudulently used emergency assistance. Is that statement accurate, yes or no?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I thank the hon. member from my region. A few minutes ago, I was reminding people in my region that, in the greater Quebec City area, about 200,000people had received this emergency benefit and that it was not for fraudulent reasons, but because they really needed it.\nMr. Grard Deltell: The question is about fraudsters, and I know that there aren't many of them in Quebec City. That said, my question is very simple. I want to know whether or not 200,000people fraudulently used emergency assistance.\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I know my colleague already knows this, but we announced at the outset that strong and rigorous mechanisms would be put in place quickly to ensure that this delivery would respect the importance of integrity in government.\nMr. Grard Deltell: The integrity of the government must be upheld, and this must be done by telling the truth. Yesterday, the National Post reported on the front page about 200,000fraudsters. Is that correct, yes or no?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: To set the record straight, the Minister of National Revenue, Ms.Lebouthillier, made it very clear that there was no tolerance for fraud in this system, that all mechanisms would be put in place to ensure that integrity would be respected.\nMr. Grard Deltell: The Treasury Board President is one of the few Canadians to find that Ms.Lebouthillier was very clear yesterday. With respect to the Minister of National Revenue, I would point out that the member for RichmondArthabaska asked her a very clear question yesterday, which she was unable to answer. What does a person who has received the full CERB, $2,000, and returns to work this week have to do? Do they have to pay back the amount they aren't entitled to? Do they keep the$2,000? Do they have to wait and include it on their next year's tax return? Which of these three options should the person choose?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I thank the hon. member for his question, which is very relevant. In fact, that person must contact Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency, depending on the system under which he or she received this benefit, and ensure that, in the circumstances that apply to him or her, the decisions and actions taken are appropriate.\nMr. Grard Deltell: It's too bad, Mr.Chair, because it's the boss who is in front of me, here in committee. It's good that the citizen calls the public servant, but the public servant's boss is the Treasury Board President. Can he give a clear indication to citizens? What should they do now with the emergency assistance they received with this month's benefit? Should they keep it in full or pay it back now? I'd like a clear answer, please.\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Again, I recognize the importance of insisting on clarity. What's clear here is that each person must make decisions based on his or her own circumstances, and the responsible way to act is to interact with public servants at Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency.\nMr. Grard Deltell: Service Canada employees must have clear instructions from their boss. The boss is here. This is the President of the Treasury Board. Could the President of the Treasury Board, in very clear terms, tell the employees answering questions from Canadians what they have to say to those currently receiving the Canada emergency response benefit, but who are actually at work? These are honest people. They are not fraudsters. They want to comply with the law. Can the President of the Treasury Board give them clear instructions?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: That is extraordinary, because my colleague focused on two key terms: honesty and hard work. In terms of the honesty of Canadians, in all cases, I am convinced that they will contact the appropriate officials. As for the hard work of those officials, they know what they have to do and they have been doing it in an exemplary way since the crisis began.\nMr. Grard Deltell: And yet those good officials, whom I frequently commend on social media for their excellent work, have no clear instructions from their boss. Mr.President, let me go back to the basic question. The National Post said that 200,000Canadians have used the emergency assistance fraudulently, to the tune of $1.6billion. Is that the case, yes or no?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I am sure that the honourable member is not questioning the ability of Canada Revenue Agency officers to follow the very clear directive of ensuring that the mechanisms reflect the importance of maintaining the integrity of the Government of Canada during the exceptional circumstances we are experiencing.\nThe Chair: We'll now go on to Ms. Gray.\nMrs. Tracy Gray (KelownaLake Country, CPC): Mr. Chair, last week British Columbia unveiled its plan to begin reopening its economy. I've been speaking with many business owners and business associations in my riding, and I'm hearing that they're not getting their orders for cleaning supplies. Some businesses have said their back orders go back to March. They do not know how they can possibly reopen if they are not meeting health cleaning standards or accessing PPE for their employees and customers. They are well aware of the issues arising from this government's reliance on Chinese manufacturing rather than building capacity here. What is the government doing to address these issues and ensure wholesale supply companies get products now so that they can distribute them to the businesses that need them?\nHon. Anita Anand (Oakville, Lib.): Mr. Chair, our government is rapidly and aggressively buying life-saving equipment that Canada needs from a diverse range of suppliers. We are building up domestic capacity as well as procuring internationally. Our priority is to make sure front-line health care workers have the support they need. In terms of other areas of the economy, we are working with our federal and provincial counterparts to make sure that we can do so in collaboration with them.\nMrs. Tracy Gray: Mr. Chair, an ongoing concern I've heard from small business owners is that they are ineligible for CEBA because they don't have a business account. When I brought up this point to small business minister Ng at committee, she said it was the first time that she had heard of this issue and that she would follow up. I asked this question on April 23, and it's now been almost three weeks. Small business has been let down. Can the government confirm that they're going to fix this issue?\nHon. Navdeep Bains (MississaugaMalton, Lib.): Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for her question. It is really important that this program that we've established help small businesses. We have shown in the past that we're very flexible and nimble in accommodating the needs of businesses. I assure the member opposite that we are looking into this matter and will come forward with a resolution in a timely manner.\nMrs. Tracy Gray: Mr. Chair, I just read another email from a small business owner this morning who has been let down by the government. He chose to pay off debts instead of paying himself a wage; therefore, he's ineligible for CEBA, for that loan. Owner-operators have been eliminated from participating in government programs because they did not put themselves on the payroll. This shows a true lack of understanding of small businesses and especially of owner-operators. Will the government commit to fixing this issue?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Thank you very much. Again, I want to thank the honourable member for her question. We have focused particularly on small businesses to make sure they have the appropriate support they need. With regard to the program that she highlighted, we have shown flexibility in the eligibility criteria by decreasing the payroll threshold for individual companies that want to apply for this loan to $20,000 versus $50,000, and the upper limit has gone to $1.5 million versus $1 million. We will continue to bring forward the changes necessary to have more businesses\nMrs. Tracy Gray: This government has left Canadian craft breweries out to dry, like the hops in their beer. On April 24, the Canadian Craft Brewers Association released a report on the effects of COVID-19 on the Canadian craft brewing industry. The report states that 38% of craft brewers did not qualify for the Canadian emergency wage subsidy in March, and 53% were either not sure or predicted that they would not qualify in April. Many a brew pub, like BNA in my riding, due to higher payrolls are also not eligible for the CEBA loan. They have been left out and let down. Five per cent of these breweries have already closed permanently, and others are on the verge of doing so. A portion have stepped up and are making PPE. Will this government take the initiative to support this industry by amending program requirements?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: When it comes to the Canada emergency wage subsidy, we have demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness. The program requirement changed in terms of revenue threshold. We originally had 30% for the month of March. We changed that to 15%. The eligibility criteria to compare to the first two months of this year now also compare to the previous year as well. We're going to continue to make changes to make sure more businesses can access this program.\nThe Chair: Ms. Gray, you have 33 seconds.\nMrs. Tracy Gray: In my constituency, Okanagan fruit production is a huge industry, and many apple orchardists have brought concerns to me regarding high costs, apples from last season selling below cost, the CUSMA agreement not helping the industy, and low-priced Washington apples flooding our market. COVID-19 has exacerbated their dire financial situation. The BC Fruit Growers' Association has called the government announcements of measures for agriculture underwhelming. I questioned Minister Bibeau in the House a couple of months ago, and at the time she did not have an answer. What is the plan to help our orchardists?\nThe Chair: The honourable minister.\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (ComptonStanstead, Lib.): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Since this crisis began, we have been helping entrepreneurs in all sectors. We began with measures to assist small, medium and large companies, and we are now going progressively sector by sector. Last week, we announced additional funding for agriculture\nThe Chair: We'll now go on to Mr. Barlow.\nMr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC): Mr. Chair, in my riding of Foothills, we've established a Foothills business recovery task force. We surveyed hundreds of small business owners about the effectiveness of the emergency programs put forward by the government. The results of that survey were quite alarming. More than half of the respondents have not qualified for any of the programs, and the vast majority of them have said their businesses will not last more than another month. Will the government expand the eligibility for some of these programs to include sole proprietorships, or is the government still looking at refunding the GST paid by some of the businesses over the last year?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I want to highlight the fact that we have issued 590,000 loans through the CEBA account. This demonstrates that this particular program is working and that businesses are taking advantage of it. We recognize that we want to be more generous and more thoughtful about these programs. We've demonstrated flexibility in the past and we will continue to be nimble going forward.\nMr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, to the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Charlebois said that we are on the precipice of losing 15% of our farms and that 30,000 farm families are at risk of bankruptcy. This will have a devastating effect on our rural economies. Does the minister know the impact that losing 30,000 family farms will have on our food security and the price of groceries on the store shelves?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, the agriculture and agri-food sector is extremely important. We have clearly stated that it is an essential service. That is why we have risk management programs that are already well established. I understand that producers would like the programs to be more generous, and we are ready to do more, but they first need to use those programs. They have $1.6billion available\nMr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, business risk management programs don't apply to every single stakeholder and the programs are not working for the producers. There is a bottleneck right now in our processing capacity. When the minister renounced the AgriRecovery program, funds were set aside for cattle and pork producers. When is that money going to be available, and how long will it last?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: We are talking about two different programs here. We added $77.5million to the program helping the processing sector and $50million on two occasions for our pork and beef producers under the AgriRecovery program. Once again, that is additional money. In recent years, an average of $15million have gone out of this program, whereas this year\nThe Chair: Mr. Barlow.\nMr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, it is not new money; it has been budgeted year after year and it's budgeted again for next year. The cattlemen said that the set-aside funds that the minister is talking about are already gone and did not last even two weeks. If this government isn't assisting Canadian farmers, is the government's food policy to rely on food imported from foreign countries to feed Canadian families ?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, the fund to assist our beef producers cannot have already disappeared because the criteria will be unveiled in the coming days. I can assure you that we are working as efficiently as possible so that the program can be rolled out and the money can be channelled to our beef and pork producers.\nMr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, producers across this country have said that an exemption from the carbon tax would help them greatly during this pandemic. When I asked the minister about any data that was available for the impact the carbon tax had on agriculture, the answer I got was that this information was secret. Yesterday at committee, the minister said that this was a mistake and that this information has been public. My staff and I looked everywhere last night, as did journalists, and that information could not be found. Is that information actually available?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Yes, Mr.Chair, that information is available and public. I will happily pass the information on to my colleague.\nMr. John Barlow: If that data is available, then the minister must know the financial impacts that the carbon tax has on Canadian farmers. With the information that the minister apparently has, does she agree with the Prime Minister that Canadian farmers are much better off financially by paying the carbon tax?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Each organization analyzes different assumptions, methodologies and geographic areas, so the results give a broad range of estimated impacts. According to the organization that has provided information, in 2019, the estimated impacts of a $20-per-tonne price on pollution due to grain drying ranged\nThe Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Barlow. You have 30 seconds, please.\nMr. John Barlow: Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister that farmers are financially better off paying the carbon tax?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, the price on pollution is an extremely important measure for our economy in general and for our transition to a greener economy. We have already provided various exemptions to the agriculture sector: for gasoline, for the access card and for the greenhouse sector.\nThe Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Kelly.\nMr. Pat Kelly (Calgary Rocky Ridge, CPC): Will the government fully fund the Office of the Auditor General?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Thank you, Mr. Chair. The answer is that we have done that in 2018 and 2019, and the Prime Minister\nMr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, I hope the minister would not want to mislead the House. The office is certainly not fully funded, as per the testimony we heard yesterday at the finance committee. This government has expanded the Auditor General's responsibilities without adequate resources. When will the government fully fund the Auditor General?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: To continue my answer, and as the Prime Minister said just a moment ago, that has led to the hiring of 38 new staff members. That's great to hear, because they are doing even better than they used to before we came into power.\nMr. Pat Kelly: No previous auditor general in Canadian history has ever had to tell a parliamentary committee that they had insufficient funds to do their job. That is what in fact this Auditor General has done. When will the government fully fund the Office of the Auditor General?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I'm glad again to be given the ability to say how important the work of the Auditor General is. We believe very much in that role. That's why we increased the funding that is necessary for that office to do its important job. We will keep working hard with the Auditor General.\nMr. Pat Kelly: Sadly, Michael Ferguson passed away in 2019, yet the government has refused to name a permanent replacement. Why?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, this is another wonderful opportunity to remind all members of this House of the importance of these institutions. When we face these tragic deaths, we of course are very sad of the passing of the people, and we work\nThe Chair: Go ahead, Mr. Kelly.\nMr. Pat Kelly: Yesterday the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that Canada's debt could reach $1 trillion this year. What will it cost to service a $1-trillion debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Mr. Speaker, we remain committed to doing, as we've said, whatever it takes to support Canadians through this challenging time. We think this is extremely important, and we will continue to focus on the well-being of all Canadians.\nMr. Pat Kelly: What is the estimated annual debt servicing cost of the aid measures announced so far?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, there will be an opportunity for us to give a full outline of the costs and benefits of our measures, and we will do that when we have the ability to have\nThe Chair: Mr. Kelly.\nMr. Pat Kelly:  is Canada's AAA credit rating.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Speaker, Canada came into this crisis with a very strong fiscal position, and of course we will experience challenges as we move forward, but we believe that we should experience those challenges as we support Canadians.\nMr. Pat Kelly: What would the effect of a downgrade be on Canada's debt servicing costs?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to focus on how we can support Canadians and Canadian businesses as we get through this challenge.\nMr. Pat Kelly: How many private sector bank loans have been funded for small and medium-sized businesses under the business credit availability program?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as the information on the business credit availability program becomes available, we are being fully transparent with the finance committee and with this House.\nMr. Pat Kelly: Does the minister know how many loans have been funded under that program?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I'm not in the habit of memorizing every single number available to us, but what I can confirm is that we will be transparent with this House on the numbers as they become available.\nMr. Pat Kelly: Does the minister know the dollar amount or the approximate dollar amount so far lent and guaranteed by Export Development Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, one number that would probably be helpful for people to understand is that we've now had over 550,000 approved loans under the CEBA program, representing over 20 billion dollars' worth of money that's actually\nThe Chair: Mr. Kelly.\nMr. Pat Kelly: Will the government fix the CEBA program to include businesses that pay owner-operators through dividends?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think the language fix is incorrect, for more than 500,000 businesses have received this loan. Of course, we are always endeavouring to make sure it works for as many businesses as possible.\nMr. Pat Kelly: Will the government fix CEBA to cover small businesses that hire day labourers or subcontractors?\nThe Chair: The honourable minister.\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, again we've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to this program. We changed the eligibility criteria to make sure that more businesses can apply and be eligible for this program. We will endeavour to make sure that more Canadians have access to this program, particularly small businesses in rural and remote communities.\nMr. Pat Kelly: Will the government fix CEBA to cover business owners who use personal instead of business chequing accounts to operate their business?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Again, Mr. Chair, I want to highlight the fact that this has been a very positive program and well received by many small businesses. Over 590,000 small business loans have been issued, and that's a testament to the design of the program. We're going to make sure we continue to engage with small businesses.\nThe Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Chong.\nHon. Michael Chong (WellingtonHalton Hills, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Last week, on Friday, Statistics Canada was to release labour force survey data at 8:30 a.m. eastern time, one of the most important and market-moving indicators of the month, but someone in the government leaked that information ahead of time, almost 45 minutes ahead of time, and exclusively to Bloomberg terminal users on Wall Street and on Bay Street, who pay thousands of dollars a month for those terminals. Moving markets, the Canadian dollar moved eight basis points in that short period of time and billions were made or lost on the market. Section 34 of the Statistics Act makes it a criminal offence for someone to leak information that might influence stock, bond or currency markets. Has the government notified the RCMP about what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act?\nThe Chair: The honourable minister.\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for his question. I, too, share the same concerns that he's highlighted with regard to this leak. This is completely unacceptable. That is why we're going to make sure that a proper and thorough examination is done, and going forward we want to make sure that no such breach or leak occurs.\nHon. Michael Chong: Mr. Chair, Statistics Canada said that staffers and ministers' offices, including the Prime Minister's office, the finance minister's office, the employment minister's office and the industry minister's office, would have received this secret information no earlier than 2 p.m. the previous day. Statistics Canada has also indicated that it has begun an internal investigation. Will the minister commit to fully co-operating with this investigation?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: I'd like to remind the honourable colleague that our government has supported Statistics Canada. We're the ones who reintroduced the mandatory long-form census. We're the ones who funded more money for Statistics Canada. The member opposite knows that we'll be fully co-operative in any such investigation into any leak.\nHon. Michael Chong: Will the minister commit to making the results of this investigation public?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, the member opposite knows full well that there are proper processes and protocols in place when it comes to such sensitive matters, and we will ensure that those processes and protocols\nThe Chair: Mr. Chong.\nHon. Michael Chong: Mr. Chair, I hope there is no double standard for ministers' offices and the public service, because it was only about 13 years ago that a public servant was criminally charged and convicted for using top secret information in the markets. I hope that in this investigation, and in the release of the information concerning this investigation, ministers' staffers aren't held to a different standard than the public service has been held to. This leak speaks to the integrity of the government. Intelligence at the Five Eyes.... Our four allies have been telling us for years that one of the top two or three threats that democracies are facing is declining public confidence in our key institutions. Democracies have been blindsided by misinformation, disinformation and cyber-attacks, and now we are being blindsided by the misuse of information by this very government. That doesn't even.... The government's own national statistics-gathering agency doesn't trust this cabinet or this government, and that's why they announced several days ago that they would suspend the pre-release of information to the cabinet. What is the government going to do to restore public confidence in our institutions?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, our government has remained steadfast in its support for Statistics Canada. I'd like to remind my honourable colleague that we are the government that brought forward legislation to strengthen the independence of Statistics Canada. We're the government that brought forward measures to make sure they have additional monies for conducting the proper mandatory long-form census as well. When it comes to the leak that the member opposite is talking about, we're not going to prejudge the outcome. We have been very clear that the proper processes and protocols that are in place will be followed.\nThe Chair: You have time for a very brief question, Mr. Chong.\nHon. Michael Chong: Mr. Chair, I hope the government will call the RCMP and notify them about what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act, because it was a previous Liberal minister who himself was subject to a lot of misinformation and was a target of improper allegations about his office's use of information that leaked about the income trust changes that the previous Liberal government had brought in. The RCMP began an investigation and, in the course of the investigation, they charged a public servant who was ultimately convicted of breaching that secret information. I hope the minister holds his office and the offices of his cabinet colleagues to the same standard, calls in the RCMP and makes them aware of what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act.\nThe Chair: The honourable minister, in 30 seconds or less, please.\nHon. Navdeep Bains: I'm sorry. How much time do I have, Mr. Chair?\nThe Chair: We're over the time, but I'm allowing 30 seconds so we can get a full\nHon. Navdeep Bains: I appreciate that very much. Again, I want to take this opportunity to say that leaks of this nature are completely unacceptable. We've been very clear that we are going to take the appropriate steps. Statistics Canada is taking the appropriate steps. I want to remind the member opposite that we're not going to prejudge any outcome at this stage. Again, it is our government that has been consistently supporting Statistics Canada in its work through the previous years.\nThe Chair: Thank you. We'll take a short break to allow our console operators to switch in a healthy way. While we're doing that, I'm going to mention something. It happens at the end of a question. When there's less than a minute left and the question goes over half the time left over, I'll just indicate to the person asking the question that we've reached the limit so that the other side can answer with the same amount of time and we have a fair playing field. We're ready to go again. The Honourable Member for BeloeilChambly has the floor.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Thank you, Mr.Chair. We are making progress, but unfortunately, I'd like to hear it in French as well. I will address my question to the Prime Minister. First, let me remind you that, on March12, the government announced a first series of measures of about $1billion to adapt to what was at the time the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, including $500million in transfers to the provinces, with about $100million going to Quebec. Since that time, the commitments from the government have reached very probably around $300billion, making those first $500 million pale by comparison. Of course, the crisis became longer and it is not over yet. In that context, and given what I heard the Prime Minister say a little earlier about respecting the areas of jurisdiction of the provinces, and of Quebec, can we expect a speedy increase in health transfers to Quebec and the provinces, an increase that would be permanent, and, of course, without conditions?\nThe Chair: The honourable minister has the floor.\nHon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Thank you, Mr.Chair. We've increased health transfers to provinces and territories significantly since we first came into government in 2015. We continue to work with provinces and territories on a regular basis to make sure they're supported not just in the outbreak of this pandemic, but in the increased cost overall to health care across the country. Our investments have included investments for mental health, for home care and for the additional expenses that provinces and territories face as a result of an aging population. We'll continue to work with provinces and territories to ensure those health care needs are met.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: With all respect, Mr.Chair, that is a little disappointing. While the leader of the NDP wants the federal government to interfere massively in provincial jurisdiction over health, the Prime Minister replies in English. That is perfectly legitimate in this Parliament, but his reply in English is, no, the government absolutely respects provincial jurisdiction. That made me happy for a brief moment, and I am asking the Prime Minister, without wanting to interrupt his precious reading, to please repeat in French was he said just now in English, that he absolutely respects provincial jurisdiction over health, which is exclusive. So could you please provide that music to my ears?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, just as I respect the member opposite's right to speak in his first language, I hope that he understands that I am trying to learn our second official language in a high-pressure situation, and it often creates anxiety. I will tell him, though, that we fully respect the jurisdiction of provinces and territories to address the needs of their constituents and their members, and we work very closely with Quebec and with all provinces and territories to make sure that the funds we transfer from the federal government can be utilized in a way that best meets the needs of their constituents.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Let's not get into that. It says to me that French is the second official language. Well, it's my first official language and it's the first one in Quebec. I would like to have heard that in French. I would like to have heard it from the Prime Minister, because it's a constitutional issue. Basically, you could say that it's our heritage. So that is what I would like to have heard. Let me proceed with a short and simple question: is health in the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces in the current crisis management situation?\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons): Mr.Chair, I would like to tell my colleague that we have no first or second official language. We have two official languages. They have the same value and the same importance. They deserve the same respect in the House and in the institutions of the government. We are always happy to collaborate with the provinces and to respect their jurisdictions.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Hearing that we have no first or second official language is better already. Between friends, let's say that they are equal. Let us take it one step further: is health in the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, we live in a federation where we work closely together with provinces and territories so that we can reach our mutually important goals, one of which is that all citizens of Canada, all members of Canada, have access to a public health care system that meets their needs. We continue to work within the constitutional framework\nThe Chair: Excuse me, but I have to interrupt you. Mr.Blanchet, you have 21seconds left.\nMr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: The answer could be even shorter than the question. Is health in provincial jurisdiction? Will there be an increase in the health transfers and will they come without conditions?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I am sure the member would argue that it is important to work together. The federal government transfers money to the provinces, as he is well aware, to deliver health care, which is within each province's and territory's jurisdiction.\nThe Chair: We now move to Mrs.Gill.\nMrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. As the member for Manicouagan, I would like to address the House today on a matter that is very important in my constituency. At 350,000square kilometres, it borders the Gulf of St.Lawrence. Regionally, I am also in eastern Quebec, which includes the Gasp, the Magdalen Islands, and the Lower St.Lawrence. These are regions whose economy rests basically on two very important seasonal industries: tourism and fishing. Make no mistake, it is not the workers who are seasonal, it is the industry itself, as our former leader Gilles Duceppe so rightly used to say. Those industries are very important for that region of Quebec, but I see no measures to support them that accommodate all their uniqueness. These are cyclical industries, meaning that they operate at a very specific period during the year. A few minutes ago, I heard the Prime Minister say that he had intervened to help the companies and the workers in those seasonal industries. I would like to know what the specific assistance is and how it is tailored to the companies and the workers in the seasonal industries he mentions.\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, I would like to thank my colleague for her question. We know that the current situation is causing upheaval in the lives of Canadians from one end of the country to the other and that it is having a major impact on our small and medium businesses. Since this crisis began, we have not hesitated to implement strong and speedy measures to support more Canadians. That is what we will continue to do. We know that the tourism sector is key to a number of communities in the country. We must help them to get through this crisis as best we can. We are continuing to have discussions and to tailor our measures so that as many Canadians as possible can take advantage of them.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, with all respect, I am hearing that nothing has been done. Measures have been proposed, but, as I understand it, they are not specific to the seasonal sectors. Let us take the seasonal fishing industry. The fishers are currently going out, but right in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis. One fishing season has been pushed back. The same thing applies to tourism. The season will be pushed back, and it is possible that there may even not be one. The people and the companies in this sector have no second chances. They cannot start again in the fall. It's a bit like agriculture. They can't start a fishing season or a tourist season in the fall. So they need assistance. We have some proposals. For example, would the government be prepared to let the Canada emergency response benefit provide workers with eligibility to employment insurance benefits? They could then get through the coming year and make it to next season.\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I want to thank the member for speaking about the situation in all regions of Canada, particularly in Quebec. From the start, we've been implementing significant measures to support the millions of workers who are currently struggling. We've taken significant measures with respect to tourism, agriculture and regional development. We're providing broader investments, such as the wage subsidy and emergency loans for small businesses, of which there are many in my colleague's constituency. We'll continue to work very hard so that the workers and businesses in her constituency can get through this crisis and emerge stronger and more united.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, that's strike two. This is the second time that I've asked a question about targeted assistance for the seasonal industry. My honourable colleague's response doesn't make me feel any better. The workers in the industry also don't feel any better when they see that, at the end of the summer, they'll have no job and no money to put food on the table. Will these workers receive assistance adapted to their needs? It's the same thing for businesses. We're currently talking about the businesses in my constituency, but there are also businesses in the East. Quebec and Canada as a whole, both in terms of fishing and tourism\nThe Chair: The honourable President of the Treasury Board has the floor.\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Thank you, Mr.Chair. My colleague probably knows the information that I'll be giving. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to all individuals who haven't been receiving employment insurance benefits since December2019. A number of stakeholders in Canada and Quebec called for this, particularly in the places\nThe Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Singh.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. The Prime Minister announced the business bailout, and in that proposal, he said that there would be limits on CEO bonuses and share buybacks. By saying limits, the Prime Minister is suggesting that there would be some amount of bonuses or share buybacks that could be paid for with public dollars. If that's the case, how much?\nThe Chair: The honourable minister.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we believe that it's very important that we support jobs. In that regard, we're trying to make sure that businesses can get through this time. As we provide that support, we've been very clear for large enterprises that share buybacks will not be allowed, period, and that there will, of course, be limitations on total compensation for senior executives in order to give Canadians confidence that we're doing the things we need to do to support them, but that we're not supporting executives.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, Germany has actually taken the lead and said that if a company wants public money, then its executives must commit to reducing their pay. Will Canada follow Germany to ensure that public dollars go to workers and not to enrich the executive suite, and commit that no public money will go to bonuses or increasing salaries for executives?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are looking forward to releasing the complete details of the large employer emergency financing facility, and I think the member opposite will be quite pleased to see that we will be leading on behalf of Canada in advance of what Germany is doing.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, we know the PBO has said that $25 billion, at least, is being lost to our revenues because corporations are avoiding paying their fair share. Will the Prime Minister commit today very clearly that if a company is hiding its money by putting it in an offshore tax haven, that company will not receive public help, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, again with regard to this program, we want to be very clear that the support that goes to large businesses actually supports their Canadian enterprises and their Canadian employees. In that regard, we will not allow any company that has been convicted of tax evasion to have access to these funds, and we will carefully evaluate on an ongoing basis to make sure that companies remain eligible for this support based on their continuing investment in Canada.\nThe Chair: Mr. Singh.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, how many companies can the Minister of Finance name that have been convicted of tax evasion that would be denied help under this program?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what's most important is that we focus on Canadians. We're trying to support Canadians, whether they're working for small or large businesses, so they can get through this, can support their families during this time, and come out with a job at the end of it. That is exactly where our focus lies in this regard.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, not a single company. We are four years past the Panama papers and there hasn't been a single conviction. Those are simply fancy Liberal words saying that a company that has been convicted of tax evasion.... There are simply no companies that this government can give as an example. Why don't we follow what France has done and commit very clearly, not in Liberal fancy words but straight up, if a company is hiding its money by using offshore tax havens, it will not get public help. Will the minister commit to that right now?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we've been working with France and other countries to make these rules stricter for businesses. The process around the common reporting standard and the base erosion profit shifting has made it more difficult for firms to move money into tax havens, and it has ensured that we have transparency in seeing when they do so. We'll continue to do that hard work to make sure that businesses abide by the rules and pay their appropriate part of taxes in our country.\nMr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, let's talk about hard work. If a company is not convicted of tax evasion, but is putting its money in Barbados or Bermuda, for example, specifically to avoid paying taxesand we have a similar example of Loblaws doing something like thiswill that company, despite not having a conviction, but clearly having avoided paying their fair share by putting their money in an offshore tax haven, receive help, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I'd suggest that the member be very careful in accusing companies of wrongdoing. We have a country that respects international rules. We allow our companies to trade and do business around the world. That continues to be important, and that supports Canadian jobs. At the same time, we're trying to make sure those international rules work and get tighter. That's what we've been working on. We'll continue to do that because we know it's important that we can work internationally. It's important that companies pay their fair share here in Canada.\nThe Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Hoback.\nMr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Liberals hand-picked ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, stated that China's conduct during the pandemic is damaging to its own soft power. However, when asked if there should be an investigation into China's behaviour during the crisis, the health minister stated that's not for her to say because she doesn't have all the evidence about what China did or didn't do. Why is Canada's ambassador to China criticizing China's actions during the pandemic while this Liberal government is defending it?\nThe Chair: The honourable Deputy Prime Minister.\nHon. Chrystia Freeland (UniversityRosedale, Lib.): Mr. Chair, Ambassador Barton is an excellent representative of Canada in China, and he is a member of our government and very much shares and helps to formulate our government's policy when it comes to China. Ambassador Barton, of course, shares our government's view that a post-crisis review is absolutely necessary.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the government's March 27 duty deferral announcement has caused tension within the trade community. Customs brokers are being asked to shoulder tremendous liability as importers are not required to make duty payments until the end of June, when there is a real possibility that some of them may find themselves insolvent. Will the government commit to a liability exemption for customs brokers whose clients are unable to pay the duties at the end of June?\nThe Chair: The honourable minister.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we have worked hard to determine programs that we think can be supportive of individuals and businesses, including allowing for deferral of taxes through this period. That we believe is important with respect to the GST, which we've allowed to be deferred until July 1, and in terms of taxes for businesses, until the end of August. We think this helps businesses to get through this challenging time, and we'll continue to support businesses and individuals so we can have a strong economy when we get through this crisis.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the following three questions are from constituents in my riding, so hopefully, I'll get some good answers for them. The first one I'll talk about is Rick. He owns a small business, a local bowling alley, in Melfort. It's a family-owned operation, so he doesn't meet the payroll threshold for the wage subsidy benefit, nor does he qualify for any other announced loans or grants. There are businesses right across Canada that are in similar situations. Is the minister suggesting that they lie to get the funds, or will they make some changes so they qualify?\nThe Chair: The honourable minister.\nHon. Navdeep Bains: I want to highlight some of the initiatives we have put forward to assist small businesses. The Canada emergency wage subsidy covers 75% of the wages of employees, and that way they can maintain their jobs. We've also put forward the enhanced work-sharing program. It's an option for businesses to pay their employees. On top of that, I want to highlight the Canada emergency business account, which has issued 590,000 loans. As the Minister of Finance recently mentioned, we've deferred GST and HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, Robert owns a cleaning products company in Prince Albert. He tells me that Canadian custodians and building service contractors are not purchasing Canadian-made disinfectants because very few are included in the federal approval list for COVID-19, even though Canada produces many products that Health Canada has certified as disinfectants. Why is the Liberal government not prioritizing the approval of Canadian-made products?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, that assertion is not correct. In fact, we have been working very closely with producers of Canadian products as well as with our colleagues at Innovation, Science and Economic Development to make sure that Canadian companies have what they need to very quickly move through the approval process. Health Canada has accelerated this process, and most companies can get approved in one to seven days. Of course, there is an iterative process that requires companies to ensure that a product is safe for use in Canada.\nMr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, last week the government announced $252 million in assistance for Canadian farmers, which was largely seen as an insult, especially given that a good amount of this money was already budgeted. A constituent of mine, Tracy, from Melfort, wrote to me asking me to advocate for farmers and ranchers so they can get the support they need to continue to produce our food. When will the government start to prioritize farmers and ranchers? Will they continue to reform the business risk management program?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Absolutely, Mr.Chair. We're working very hard with our provincial colleagues to improve the risk management programs. We did announce programs last week, and some of these new programs are designed specifically for the meat sector. A total of $77.5million is earmarked for processors and $50million for beef producers.\nThe Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Calkins.\nMr. Blaine Calkins (Red DeerLacombe, CPC): Mr. Chair, provinces are reopening at different speeds, and that includes opening their provincial parks before the May long weekend. It no longer makes sense for fully staffed national parks across the country to be uniformly closed. Will the Minister of Environment commit to opening national parks in harmony with provincial and territorial parks across Canada?\nHon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, we are working very closely with our provincial partners on the reopening. I am pleased that we were able to publish, on Tuesday, April 28, shared guidelines on the reopening, which were supported by the Prime Minister and all of the premiers of the provinces and territories\nThe Chair: Mr. Calkins.\nMr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, boating is a safe way to enjoy the outdoors while maintaining physical distancing. Why is Parks Canada postponing the opening of lock operations and similar functions along our heritage waterways?\nHon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, as I was saying in my answer to the first question, the question of coordinating national and provincial parks is a very good one. That is something we are definitely working on.\nMr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, since the beginning of this pandemic, the minority Liberal government has been actively trying to push our democracy aside. It severely limited parliamentary sittings, attempted to take executive control of tax rates and used an order in council to ban lawfully acquired and responsibly owned firearms. When will the government stop using this pandemic as an excuse to run roughshod over our cherished democratic values?\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez: I don't understand this question at all, since we're meeting here to ask questions for twohours and 15minutes. That's the equivalent of three question periods. Yesterday, there was the equivalent of two question periods, and tomorrow there will be the equivalent of two more question periods. We're talking about seven question periods. That's more than normal.\nMr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, the inconsistency in support for various sectors in our economy is baffling. There is more money made available to forcibly confiscate lawfully owned property than in emergency support for our hard-working farmers or our prosperity-creating oil and gas sector. The only consistent theme appears to be that sectors that do not traditionally vote Liberal are finding themselves left out in the cold. If that is not the case, why is there such an obvious discrepancy?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, those comments are completely unjustified. We're fully committed to our sectors, including the energy sector and the agriculture and agrifood sector. This is particularly important. These sectors are critical. That's why we're working to improve our risk management programs. We want to ensure that the criteria are broader and that more producers can benefit from these programs.\nMr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, during the misinformation briefing, the public safety minister used Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom as examples for firearms policy. Does the public safety minister realize that these countries are islands and none share a border with anyone, least of which with the United States of America? Is my bringing this new-found evidence to the minister's attention going to change his focus to smugglers, gangs and criminals, instead of wrongfully blaming lawful gun owners?\nHon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Mr. Chair, I would like to assure the member that I have actually seen an atlas. I want to be very clear that those countries have recognized, like Canada has, that these weapons have no place in a civil society. They were designed for soldiers to engage in combat with other soldiers. They were not designed for hunting and sporting purposes, which are the lawful uses of a firearm in Canada, but rather for individuals to kill other individuals. Tragically, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, that is precisely what they have been used for, and we have prohibited\nThe Chair: Mr. Calkins.\nMr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, the nine o'clock gun is an iconic 12-pound cannon that has been fired daily in Vancouver in Stanley Park since the 1800s. It's now a prohibited firearm as of May 1, 2020. Can the minister advise the public of the safety risks that this cannon, which was manufactured in 1816, poses to the public?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, I assume the member opposite is referring to the prohibition of grenade launchers. There are about 34 in Canada and we have brought in regulations that now prohibit grenade launchers. It does not apply to some of the other things that have been suggested by the member opposite.\nMr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, I was referring to the iconic, heritage 12-pound cannon that is mounted on a pedestal in Stanley Park. It was manufactured in 1816. Any cannon that can be fired can be loaded with a projectile, so it meets the definition of a firearm, which means that every cannon in Canada, every heritage piece that might be in a museum, every heritage piece that might be in a collection, is now a prohibited firearm. Was the minister not aware of this when he announced this policy?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, just to help the member opposite, let us be very clear. We have prohibited weapons that were unfortunately widely available in Canada and were being used for purposes other than sporting activities, which is the only use of a firearm in Canada, for either hunting or target shooting sporting activities. Rather, they were being used to harm individual Canadians and, in some tragic cases, many individual Canadians. We've done the right thing, Mr. Chair, and we\nThe Chair: We'll go to Mr. Nater next.\nMr. John Nater (PerthWellington, CPC): Mr. Chair, agricultural societies across rural Ontario are making the difficult decision to cancel their fall fairs this year. Some of these fall fairs have been around since before Confederation. Not only is this a terrible loss for these communities of important community events, but it's also putting a significant financial strain on these agricultural societies. What action is the government taking to support agricultural societies in Canada?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, what we've done is we've put forward monies to support our regional development agencies. These agencies have the mandate and the ability to support local initiatives, including the events the member has highlighted. This is more than doubling the budget that currently exists, so that we have sufficient resources to support communities and these very important local events.\nMr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, the arts and culture industry has a massive impact on local economies. In my riding alone we have the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, the Stratford Festival, Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music. The postponement and cancellation of the seasons of these important cultural institutions is having a massive impact on the hospitality industry, including local restaurants, hotels and bed and breakfasts. Many of these businesses are small businesses and owner-operated businesses that are falling through the cracks in the government's programs that have been introduced. How will the government address the blind spot in their programs for small businesses in communities like this, which rely on the tourism and the arts and culture industries?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, clearly, we understand how important these organizations are to these communities. That is why we allocated $500 million to respond to the specific financial needs of arts, heritage and sports organizations, to help them be more resilient through this difficult time. Last week we rolled out the funding of this announcement, and we look forward to engaging with communities across the country.\nMr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, 1.8 million jobs are attributed to the tourism industry in Canada. Among these, 740,000 are related to international travelling. No one wants to see the borders reopen until it's safe to do so, but can the government provide clarity on what criteria will be used to provide some information to these tourism operators of how, when and under what criteria international borders will be reopened?\nHon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the member opposite for his view that we need to be cautious and prudent and put the health and safety of Canadians first. That is very much the view of our government as well. When it comes to international borders, the health and safety of Canadians is absolutely the first criterion we are going to look at. Of course, we will be looking at the situation with coronavirus\nThe Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Nater.\nMr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, many Canadians continue to fall through the cracks of programs announced by this government. One of my constituents only recently returned to the workforce after spending many years out of the workforce raising her children. As such, she doesn't qualify under the $5,000 minimum requirement for income over the past 12 months. How will the government address these people who are falling through the cracks?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, we are mindful of the very difficult circumstances in which many Canadians who have a foot in two places find themselves. We have a number of different measures to help them and we're going to continue to do so.\nMr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, it has been reported that as many as 15% of farmers and farm families in Canada could face going out of business and bankruptcy because of the massive impact that COVID-19 is having on agriculture in Canada. Business risk management programs are not working for these farm families, and the processing capacity is simply not there for farmers and for farm families, especially in the beef and pork industries. How will the government immediately address the short-term processing capacity issues found in the beef and pork sectors? When will they finally live up to the commitment of a complete review of the business risk management programs?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, I've been holding discussions with my provincial counterparts to review the risk management programs. With respect to the AgriStability program, we've offered producers some accommodations and pushed back the enrolment date to July3. We've also increased, from 50% to 75%, the advance payment that they can obtain quickly, in provinces where this is possible. We've also posted a calculator online. So before they say that the program isn't working, I encourage them to use this calculator to find out how much they can receive.\nMr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, this government continues to show a blind spot for small businesses in Canada. Many don't qualify for the CEBA because they don't have a high enough payroll or because they don't have a business account. So many small businesses are falling through the cracks. Will the government expand the criteria so that small businesses in my community and across Canada can qualify for the important assistance they need at this time?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I would like to remind my honourable colleague that we did expand the eligibility criteria threshold from $50,000 down to $20,000 so that more businesses could be eligible, and on the top end, for salaries, from $1 million to $1.5 million. That is why we have seen 590,000 small business loans issued. That's a testament to the program.\nThe Chair: The next question will go to Mr. Maguire.\nMr. Larry Maguire (BrandonSouris, CPC): Mr. Chair, hog and beef producers have seen drastic price drops. Producers are telling me that they would use the western livestock price insurance program if the premiums were affordable, which they are not. Will the Minister of Agriculture work with the industry to make the premiums affordable so that producers can have price protection against these market fluctuations?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr. Chair, we're working closely with the industry and my provincial counterparts to identify the best programs to help producers in this difficult time. Last week, we announced specific programs for the meat sector: $77.5million for processors, $50million for beef producers and $50million for pork producers.\nMr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, Chez Angela Bakery in Brandon has seen tremendous success since it opened two years ago. Due to this growth and the eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy program, their revenues would have to decline much further than 30% in order for them to receive help. Will the Minister of Finance amend the eligibility for the wage subsidy program so that Chez Angela and similar businesses can apply?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)): The honourable Minister of Industry.\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for his question. I want to highlight the fact that we did make an amendment. When we originally proposed this initiative, the threshold was 30% for the month of March. Now businesses will only need to show a 15% decline in revenue, and businesses will have the option of using January and February as a reference period to show revenue losses, or of using the same time last year. This reflects, again, our ability to understand the needs of businesses, to act quickly and to make sure that they benefit from this very important initiative.\nMr. Larry Maguire: They still don't qualify, Mr. Chair. The Blarney Stone restaurant in Killarney has repeatedly asked the Minister of Finance if they could refinance their loans through the Canada small business financing program. Will the Minister of Finance give small business owners the ability to refinance their existing loans through the program, yes or no?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, again, we've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to these financing options. I'd also like to highlight another very important initiative that was mentioned earlier, the deferring of GST/HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months. This will help 3.2 million business owners and entrepreneurs across the country. Again, it's another initiative to put more money in the pockets of businesses as they deal with this unprecedented health care crisis.\nMr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, the Liberals still haven't fixed the payroll eligibility problems for many small business owners who need to access the zero-interest loans available in CEBA. Can the minister provide any rationale for why countless small businesses are not being allowed to access these loans?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, as of today, 590,000 small business loans have been issued. I think that's contrary to the point the member opposite is making. Clearly we recognize that we need to be agile and that we need to understand the needs of businesses. That's why we made changes to this particular program. We'll continue to listen to businesses. I can assure the member opposite that 590,000 small business loans is no small feat.\nMr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, Canada has some of the best competitive sport shooters in the world. The Liberals' order in council on firearms will put an end to many Canadians being able to represent our country. Can the Minister of Public Safety list even one of these sport shooting competitions, which will now be illegal due to his order in council?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable Minister of Public Safety.\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, it's an important question because sport shooting is a very important tradition for many Canadian sport shooters. I want to assure the member opposite that the weapons we have prohibited by this order in council were not designed for sport shooting and are not used in the Olympics or Paralympic Games. They are not included in this and therefore have no impact on that activity of legitimate sport shooting.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one more short question, Mr. Maguire.\nMr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, statistics show that women are more likely to live paycheque to paycheque, so women continue to be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic in a negative way. Many are worried they won't have a job to go back to. Will the government commit to helping women who are bearing this financial burden return to the workforce?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, this is a very good question. I would love to have a lot of time to answer it. The answer is yes, of course. We are making sure that many of our measures do not disproportionately impact women, because when women succeed, all Canadians succeed.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now continue with Mr.Blanchette-Joncas.\nMr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas (Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLes Basques, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. It's a privilege to be here in the House today to represent the people of Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques, but also to serve as the BlocQubcois tourism critic. Tourism in Quebec is a significant economic engine and wealth creator. This industry is vital to the regions of Quebec, as I'll demonstrate. The tourism industry in Quebec generates over $15billion in economic spinoffs and employs more than 400,000workers. In Quebec, one in tenjobs is connected to the tourism industry. Every dollar spent on tourism generates about 70cents in the Quebec economy. The tourism industry consists of over 30,000businesses, and two-thirds of these businesses are outside the major centres in the Quebec City and Montreal regions. In the tourism industry, 82% of businesses have fewer than 20employees. This shows once again the need to support this industry. I heard my honourable colleague on the other side of the House say that a plan was in place for the tourism industry. I want to hear what he has to say about this plan. To date, what specific measures has the government taken to support the tourism industry?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, I want to thank my colleague for his question. He's right. The situation is very difficult for all regions of our country and for Quebec. That's why we've invested in regional development. These investments will improve the situation in the tourism sector. These investments will provide assistance for festivals, programs and other initiatives. We'll continue to work with my colleague and the other members to find solutions that will improve the situation.\nMr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: Mr.Chair, I'm not sure that I fully understood the plan. However, I can say that the people in the tourism industry don't understand the plan, because they're still waiting for it. One issue in the tourism industry involves fixed costs. Initially, we asked that part of the wage subsidy be set aside to cover fixed costs. The government implemented the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance. The assistance covers 75% of commercial rental payments under $50,000, and property owners pay the remaining 25%. To date, how many applications have been submitted under this program?\nHon. Bill Morneau: The wage subsidy is very significant. However, we know that there are other fixed costs. That's why we've taken other measures, such as the measures related to credit and rent. We've combined several measures that will help companies bridge the gap until the end of the crisis.\nMr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: We expect to hear a figure and not necessarily words. We could see that the program was ineffective, particularly for seasonal businesses, including businesses in the tourism industry. Businesses need to have suspended operations or to show a decline of at least 70% in operations since the start of the public health crisis. How can a tourism business that hasn't yet launched operations show a decline of 70%? It doesn't make sense. A recent survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows that only one in ten businesses can benefit from this assistance. Yet these businesses need the assistance. Does the government believe that commercial rent assistance is effective even though only one in ten businesses can benefit from it?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, I know that the situation is very difficult. That's why we've introduced another option. Through the community futures development corporations and business development centres, we're providing $71million to businesses and organizations in rural communities by giving them much-needed access to capital. This investment will help many businesses in Quebec, particularly in the tourism sector.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Blanchette-Joncas, you have one minute left.\nMr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: Mr.Chair, in my humble opinion, one out of ten businesses amounts to 10%. This figure isn't very high and is far from a passing grade. What does the government plan to do? Does it plan to implement an expanded program to support businesses in the tourism and seasonal industries to ensure that fixed costs are more fully covered?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, we have a strategy. We've invested in regional development and in small and medium-sized businesses. We've helped the workers and we'll continue to work with the provincial governments to find solutions. We must work together, particularly in the tourism sector, because the situation in the sector is very serious. I'm sure that we can find solutions to help improve the situation for people in the tourism sector.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now continue with Mr. Van Bynen.\nMr. Tony Van Bynen (NewmarketAurora, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I would like to inform you that I will be splitting my time with the member for Kingston and the Islands. Mr. Chair, last week was Mental Health Week. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of stress and uncertainty for all Canadians and that during this uncertain time, it is normal for many people to feel increased anxiety, depression and mental health issues. In fact, a poll by the Canadian Mental Health Association's Ontario branch showed that 61% of respondents were worried about the mental health of a loved one and more than half of the respondents were worried about their own mental health. In the Standing Committee on Health, we've also heard from many witnesses that our front-line heroes, working around the clock to protect us from the virus and to help others recover, are at great risk of physical and mental burnout. This shows how seriously Canadians need supports for their mental health and well-being during this most trying time. Can the Minister of Health tell my constituents what the government is doing to support Canadians during this uncertain time?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I thank the member for NewmarketAurora for that very insightful question. In fact, we've been very worried about Canadians' mental health as resulting from the pandemic, but even prior to that we knew that we needed to create rapidly more tools for Canadians across the country, no matter where they lived. We've worked very closely with our provincial and territorial partners, for example, to amplify the work that they're doing through increased supports, financial supports. We also launched Wellness Together Canada, which is a digital portal, where all Canadians can get access to tools they can use to help with the circumstances they find themselves in and to get the information they need during COVID-19. It also allows Canadians to connect to paid professionals who can provide support in a variety of different ways, whether it's over the telephone, through email or by text, understanding that Canadians have different ways of connecting that work for them. We've also partnered with a number of organizations that provide supports to Canadians, many of the crisis hotlines, for example, that are working double-time or triple-time to try to keep up with the volume of demand. This is a difficult time for all Canadians and we will continue to work to ensure Canadians have the supports they need.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go to Mr. Gerretsen, from Kingston and the Islands.\nMr. Mark Gerretsen (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.): Mr. Chair, students from across the country have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19. As we know, thousands of post-secondary students depend on employment throughout the summer in order to pay for expenses throughout their academic year. Unfortunately the pandemic has resulted in the closure of many businesses and organizations that would normally employ students who work during the summer. Thousands of students are now left without the financial means they were depending on to pay for their post-secondary educational expenses. In response to the concerns raised by students, the government announced the creation of the Canada emergency student benefit, which will provide students with the assistance they need to make it through these uncertain financial times. I represent a riding that has multiple post-secondary institutions, and my constituents have been asking when they should expect to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit. Can the President of the Treasury Board please give us an update on the status of the Canada emergency student benefit, and in particular, when students will be able to start accessing this benefit, and also confirm if and how it may be retroactive?\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, I would first like to thank the member for Kingston and the Islands for his strong advocacy in favour of young Canadians in his riding and across Canada. Mr. Chair, our government is committed to ensuring that young Canadians have the support that they need during this very difficult time. That's why we are investing $9 billion to support students and recent graduates affected by COVID-19. The measures include doubling the Canada student grants, raising the cap on student loans, creating new employment opportunities for students and launching the Canada emergency student benefit. I'm pleased to share with the House that the application period for the Canada emergency student benefit will commence on May 15. That is this Friday. This benefit will provide $1,250 a month to eligible students or $2,000 for students who have disabilities or dependants. Mr. Chair, when Canada emerges from this pandemic, we want to make sure that students are in a financial position to continue their studies so that they can pursue fruitful careers and help build a strong Canada.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll wait a few seconds before moving on to the next five-minute period to allow the console operator to switch with someone else. We'll next go to the honourable member for Calgary Skyview, Ms. Sahota.\nMs. Jag Sahota (Calgary Skyview, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Victims of human trafficking continue to suffer during this crisis. Many are facing worse conditions and additional barriers to escaping human trafficking than before the pandemic. The government has been completely silent on this issue, and now funding to fight human trafficking is being taken away from front-line organizations. Why would the government choose to do this at this vulnerable time?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, human trafficking is, as we all know, one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. Our government is working to eliminate all instances of it. To combat human trafficking, we've launched a comprehensive national strategy that brings together federal efforts under one strategic framework. We have backed that new move with $75 million in additional investments, and the new strategy now strengthens Canada's ability to fight this abhorrent attack on human rights and human dignity.\nMs. Jag Sahota: Mr. Chair, this simply isn't good enough. The government is letting down our most vulnerable Canadians. We know that human trafficking hasn't stopped during this pandemic, and these front-line organizations have received the message that supporting them in fighting these heinous crimes is not a priority. What is the minister going to do to rectify this situation?\nHon. Bill Blair: As I said, we have developed a national strategy to combat human trafficking. We've made $75 million in additional investments, and this new strategy takes a whole-of-government approach. It empowers victims and survivors to regain their self-confidence and control over their lives, and it will prevent more of these crimes from taking place. It provides better protection and support for those most vulnerable to human trafficking, and it will ensure that police and prosecutors have the resources to prosecute these traffickers for their heinous crimes. Mr. Chair, we'll continue to work collaboratively with victims groups and to provide the supports that are required.\nMs. Jag Sahota: Mr. Chair, more vulnerable Canadians continue to be let down. There are effective medications that have been developed for those living with cystic fibrosis, yet this medication is not available here. We know that the pharmaceutical company has not been able to apply to market this drug in Canada because of the changes to the PMPRB, which have been heavily criticized by stakeholders and patients. Will the minister delay the July 1 implementation date and review the regulations so that drugs like Trikafta are made available in Canada?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, there are two separate issues in that question, so I will talk about the PMPRB. As a government, we are committed, as you know, to increasing affordability of and accessibility to Canadian medications, to medications across Canada, and the PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians to be able to afford their prescriptions. Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower prices for medicine gain access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada, or even faster.\nMs. Jag Sahota: Mr. Chair, for those living with a rare disease, every single day can be a struggle. We know the importance of lowering drug costs, but not at the cost of life-saving drugs not being available here in Canada. Waiting years for the government to reduce regulations is not an option. We also know that the nature of the disease makes those people more susceptible to contracting COVID-19, and they are at a higher risk of its being lethal. Why is this government continuing to let those with CF struggle and suffer needlessly?\nHon. Patty Hajdu: I believe the member opposite is talking about the drug Trikafta, and many cystic fibrosis patient groups have been advocating having access to it in Canada. In fact, the manufacturer of Trikafta has not submitted an application to market this product in Canada. However, that said, we do have a special access program for drugs that are not marketed in Canada. As of May 6, Health Canada approved 95 applications for 98 patients to access Trikafta through the special access program. I would encourage all patients with cystic fibrosis to speak to their doctor to ensure that they too can apply through the special access program.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one short question of 45 seconds.\nMs. Jag Sahota: We know the importance of lowering drug costs. As you know, 4,300 people suffer from this rare genetic disease. Most of them are children and young adults. One young woman from Calgary is a CF champion, fighting for her passion to be a famous opera singer. She's very talented. Her reality of living with CF has meant that she has had many visits to the hospital and had many health crises that have made singing impossible for a time. CF patients are waiting for this drug, which was fast-tracked in other countries. Now it seems that the changes to the PMPRB will cause further delays or complications. Will the minister delay the implementation and review the PMPRB?\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Honourable Minister, please provide a short response.\nHon. Patty Hajdu: I will just repeat that the manufacturer has not applied to sell this drug in Canada.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we will go to Mr. Lobb of HuronBruce.\nMr. Ben Lobb (HuronBruce, CPC): Thank you very much. On July 25, 2019, after the federal-provincial-territorial agriculture meeting, the agriculture minister promised big changes in 2020 for programs like AgriStability and AgriRecovery. Besides a pilot program in a couple of provinces and an application deadline, is there anything else you would like to report?\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Yes, Mr.Chair. Since the July meeting in QuebecCity with the provincial and territorial ministers of agriculture, we've been working to improve the AgriStability program. This issue remains a priority, and it's included in my mandate letter. However, at this time, we're responding to emergencies that go beyond what the various risk management programs can provide to our producers.\nMr. Ben Lobb: You can appreciate, Minister, the issue we're dealing with here. The United States Department of Agriculture has allocated $19 billion to farmers, $16 billion of that in direct support. The program that was offered last week, $252 million, was a mere fraction of what the United States is getting. If the minister is telling farmers to bank on the existing business risk management program, it's not going to work. Countless numbers of pork farmers, just in my riding alone, have one thousand, two thousand, three thousand head of hogs ready to be shipped within the near future. They will lose $70 a head. AgriStability isn't going to cut it. We need an immediate program to help out these hard-working pork farmers.\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: I fully understand my colleague's comments. That's why we announced specific programs for the meat sector: $77.5million for processors, $50million for beef producers and $50million for pork producers. We've also increased, improved and facilitated access to AgriStability. One pork producer tried the calculator and told me that he could quickly receive $11 per head of hog. Alberta's agriculture minister even publicly stated that some producers could obtain the desired amount of $20 per head using the AgriStability program.\nMr. Ben Lobb: Mr. Chair, you can see the problem right there with the math. The minister just said that one of her pork producers is going to get $11. They are losing $70. There's a $59-per-head gap, times likely several thousand head of hogs in their barns. Let's go to another trying issue with agriculture. It's the carbon tax. I know that the government has their position on the carbon tax, and I know that I'm not going to change it, but I want to give the members of Parliament across the way, the government, an idea of what a pork farmer might go through. A pork farmer sent me their bill for February 26 to March 24. Their natural gas bill was about $2,400. In there was close to $500 in federal carbon tax. Farmers manage their woodlots ethically. They have environmental farm plans. They have nutrient management plans. They get no credit for any of the carbon sequestration and ethical environmental management on their farm, yet every month they are asked to pay a carbon tax. It just doesn't seem fair. I want the minister's opinion on that.\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: As you know, our pollution pricing policy is designed to build a clean economy. We've introduced exemptions for agriculture. On one hand, emissions from animal and vegetable production are not subject to carbon pricing, and on the other hand, farm fuels and other fuels delivered to off-farm points-of-sale are exempt. We've also provided partial reimbursements for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses. We have already done a lot. We encourage producers to take advantage of the business risk management programs, and we are ready to do more. We've already shown that, and we will continue to do so.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): There is time for one short question and response. Go ahead, Mr. Lobb.\nMr. Ben Lobb: Mr. Chair, I know the Minister of Agriculture has toured my riding. She knows very well what the lay of the land is here. What about pork farmers? What about chicken farmers? What about hens? What about drying in the fall? All those farmers pay a carbon tax, and there is no program for them. They pay and they pay and they pay, and what makes it worse is that they are given no credit for the environmental work they do on their farms.\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: It's true that our producers work incredibly hard to protect the environment and ensure the well-being of their animals. That's important, to be sure, but I'd like to put the impact of pollution pricing into perspective. To put these estimates into context, AAFC used data from agricultural tax data programs to show the impact on a per-farm basis as a percentage of total operating costs. The estimates ranged from $210 to $819 per farm and 0.05% to 0.42% of total farm operating expenses.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We now move on to Mr.Lehoux.\nMr. Richard Lehoux (Beauce, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Being from a rural area, myself, I can assure you that people who live in rural communities are resourceful and resilient. Instead of staying cooped up in their homes, they are doing their best to retool and save the companies they work for. One of the only options they have is to work from home. Unfortunately, though, they don't have access to the tools they need. Cellular and Internet networks are inadequate, even non-existent in some cases. I want to know, not whether the government is going to help these Canadians join the 21st century, but when. Can you give us any assurances and, above all, a timetable for a real plan?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: I agree with the member. The situation is very serious. High-speed Internet is not a luxury; it's a necessity. That's why we launched the connect to innovate program. My fellow minister Ms. Monsef will be introducing the next strategy to improve the situation in all regions, especially rural areas. Finding a solution is absolutely imperative.\nMr. Richard Lehoux: I don't think the minister understood my question. In the 2019 budget, the government promised to connect all Canadians to the Internet by 2030. This is 2020. That's 10years away. People don't need reliable Internet service 10years down the road. The pandemic has made the need even more acute right now. When, then, will people have Internet access? I'm simply asking you for a date now.\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, under the last budget, we launched a $1.7-billion program to support broadband infrastructure. That's a lot of money for high-speed Internet. My fellow minister Ms.Monsef is in charge of the program. We also introduced the connect to innovate program, which has helped 900communities all over the country. We will keep working to make the lives of people who live in rural areas better, and we will find solutions to provide high-speed Internet access.\nMr. Richard Lehoux: Mr.Chair, you no doubt know that Beauce is the cradle of small and medium-sized businesses. On March27, the Prime Minister introduced the emergency wage subsidy to help businesses cope with the pandemic. Unfortunately, general partnerships were overlooked. Of the many constituents in my riding who have reached out to me on the subject, one, in particular, has contacted me three times since mid-April. I still don't have anything to tell him because the government is dragging its feet. We'd like to get a clear and specific answer. The same goes for sole proprietors, who were also overlooked. When is the government going to include these businesses in the current programs?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, we announced in financial support for vulnerable small and medium-sized businesses that are not eligible for the measures already in place and that are struggling with cash flow issues. We've also invested $71million to support businesses and organizations by giving them access to capital in rural communities. As well, we've invested in programs for rural areas, and we will continue to make investments to help small and medium-sized businesses.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Lehoux, please keep it brief.\nMr. Richard Lehoux: All right, Mr.Chair. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture asked the federal government for an agriculture and agri-food emergency fund of $2.6billion to help maintain food security in Canada in response to COVID-19. Will the minister address the federation's request? Minister, I'd like you to give us a date.\nHon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: We already have a host of business risk management programs, through which, $1.6billion is available to producers annually. More support is actually available, even through those programs, since they meet the demand. We are prepared to do more, and we will. I urge producers to apply for the AgriStability program and to use the funds in their AgriInvest accounts. Some $2.3billion is available through that program.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now go to the honourable member for LangleyAldergrove, Mr. Van Popta.\nMr. Tako Van Popta (LangleyAldergrove, CPC): Mr. Chair, the government's wage subsidy program is designed to help traditional companies, not high-growth companies. For example, I was talking to Ron, who operates an engineering firm in my riding that specializes in designing and building very expensive machines for their ever-expanding overseas markets. Business is down, but not by the requisite 30%. Of course not, since they're in high-growth mode, but just recently they had to lay off some very talented staff. Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program can be expanded or adapted to deal with high-growth companies that will play such a key role in Canada's economic relaunch?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, my honourable colleague is absolutely correct. We, the government, take enormous pride in our small businesses, particularly the start-ups and the high-growth firms. They're going to be absolutely essential for our economic recovery, and we know that some of them are ineligible for the wage subsidy. That is why we introduced a $250-million program in the industrial research assistance program through the National Research Council, strictly targeting and focusing on those high-growth firms that were ineligible for the wage subsidy, so that they can provide the wage support to keep those highly skilled individuals in Canada.\nMr. Tako Van Popta: Mr. Chair, there is another category of businesses that are falling through the cracks and feel they are being left behind by the wage subsidy program. Those are recently merged companies. For example, there is a trucking company in my riding that is significantly bigger this year than it was last year as a result of some key acquisitions and mergers late last year. All of the legacy companies by themselves would qualify individually for the wage subsidy, but the merged company does not. Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program is sufficiently flexible to accommodate recently merged companies?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, again I want to thank my honourable colleague for his question. He is identifying unique pain points that exist within the overall economy with specific examples of companies that are not able to access some of the programming we have provided. I do want to highlight, when it comes to the wage subsidy, that we have made changes to the revenue thresholds to make more companies eligible. The specific example that the member opposite raises is something that is under consideration.\nMr. Tako Van Popta: Mr. Chair, the government's commercial rent assistance program discriminates against certain tenants based solely on whether their landlord has a mortgage on the subject building. I was talking to Leslie the other day. She manages a number of commercial office buildings in my riding. Some of these buildings have mortgages and some don't, and it all depends on what they were able to negotiate with their banker. Leslie is having a very hard time explaining to her tenants why some will qualify for the rental subsidy and some won't, depending on which building they are in. Can the government confirm that the nonsensical mortgage requirement in the rent subsidy program is gone?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the approach that was taken on trying to assist small businesses with rent is very much based on the fact that this is a provincial jurisdiction, so we have used the mortgage system as a way to do it. It is, in fact, not nonsensical. That said, we are looking at this particular issue. It's something that is under consideration. We expect that we will find a way to ensure that those landlords who don't have mortgages can work with the CMHC to have the appropriate approach to be eligible for this program.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have about one minute left, Mr. Van Popta. Go ahead with a short question.\nMr. Tako Van Popta: Many people in my riding have reached out to me to say they are quite disturbed that their favourite hunting and sport shooting firearms are now on the banned list. Can the minister inform Canadians how many Canadian taxpayer dollars are going to go to the buyback program for legal gun owners and how far that money would go if it were to be diverted to something useful, such as more border controls to stop the illegal importation of firearms?\nHon. Bill Blair: Our first priority is the protection and safety of Canadians. We've seen an unacceptable rise in gun violence right across our community. All weapons are being regulated in our country. Some, such as handguns, represent such a significant risk that we strongly restrict them. Some weapons, quite frankly, are completely unsuitable for any sporting or hunting activity, such as weapons designed for soldiers to engage in combat with other soldiers. We have now prohibited those weapons. The saving of lives is worth an investment in public safety. I want to assure the member we will bring forward legislation that will facilitate an appropriate buyback program. I look forward to a discussion in this House with the member opposite on how that can be done to ensure public safety and to ensure that we do it in as effective a way as possible.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now go to Mr. Manly.\nMr. Paul Manly: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to thank the government and ministers present for the rapid relief that they've provided to Canadians. I know the constituents in my riding really appreciate that. I'd like to thank them also for being responsive to the MPs who have brought forward gaps in the program. The CERB requirements recognize dividend income for eligibility for the Canada emergency business account, CEBA, but the Canada emergency business account does not recognize dividends or contract payments. I've been contacted by many small business owners who have been legally paying themselves with dividends for years, but these companies cannot apply for the CEBA even though this might save them from bankruptcy during this crisis. Will the government make the necessary changes to allow dividend income to be admissible for CEBA eligibility?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: I'd like to thank the honourable colleague for his very thoughtful question and his advocacy in looking for different solutions and in working with us to help small businesses, not only in his riding but across the country as well. He's absolutely correct that the Canada emergency business account has been successful, as 590,000 loans have been issued. That's a reflection of some of the changes that we introduced, which made the criteria more generous so that more businesses could obtain assistance. He has raised the issue of dividends. As I said before, we continue to work with Canadians and Canadian businesses and colleagues in this House to see how we can assist more Canadians, not less of them, and we'll continue to endeavour to do that.\nMr. Paul Manly: Mr. Chair, there are still many Canadians stranded overseas who are trying to return to Canada. Some have no assurance that their non-Canadian spouse will be allowed into Canada with them. Many are being forced to make an impossible choice between sheltering in place overseas or separating from their spouse in order to return home. Will the government remove unnecessary barriers and allow these Canadians to return to Canada immediately with their spouses?\nHon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, in an effort to flatten the curve and to protect Canadians, we've taken a number of extraordinary measures at the border and we have restricted non-essential travel of people coming into Canada. While Canadian citizens and permanent residents will always be admissiblesubject, of course, to a 14-day quarantine upon entry foreign nationals are subject to travel restrictions. For individuals to be eligible to travel to Canada, their travel must be considered essential travel, consistent with the emergency order put in place. I recognize and very much respect the spirit of the member's question. We recognize these are difficult situations. It is not our desire to keep families apart. I want to assure that each situation will be decided on a case-by-case basis based on the information made available to border service officers. I welcome any inquiries he may have. If he reaches out to my office, we'll help in any way we can.\nMr. Paul Manly: Mr. Chair, the Alberta energy regulator has suspended a wide range of environmental monitoring requirements for oil sands companies during this pandemic. This includes environmental reporting. It includes wetland wildlife and bird monitoring, even though Canada is a signatory to the international migratory bird treaty. Water that escapes from storm ponds doesn't need to be tested. Air quality programs, including for first nations communities, have been reduced. Testing for leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, has been suspended. This is after the federal government has provided $750 million in funding for methane emission reductions. The federal government has also just committed $1.7 billion to clean up orphaned oil wells. That message, clearly, is about the negligence of the Alberta government. It is something corporations should be paying for. Will the federal government hold the Alberta government to account and withhold energy sector relief funding until these environmental regulations are reinstated?\nHon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the member for his question and for his very collaborative approach with our government on a number of issues. I would like to thank him for this particular question and his particular reference to methane, because it gives me an opportunity to highlight some very important progress that the federal government made this week in working with the Province of Alberta. Just yesterday Alberta joined B.C. and Saskatchewan and published its own draft regulations on methane. This will allow us, in working with Alberta, to work on equivalency on methane, which will allow us to work towards standing down the federal system in those jurisdictions. This is tremendously important, because it will allow us to cut methane emissions by 45% by 2025. It's hugely important for fighting climate change together.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to the honourable member for Hamilton Mountain, Mr. Duvall.\nMr. Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain, NDP): Mr. Chair, I was pleased to hear about extending the tax deadline to October 1 in yesterday's announcement for seniors. After many discussions with the Minister of Seniors, I was glad to hear that she was listening to the NDP and many others on making this happen. It stops a lot of interruptions for people who couldn't get their taxes done. Mr. Chair, COVID-19 has been showing us in stark terms that Canadian seniors are struggling to make ends meet in Canada. Before enduring the crisis, it was clear that OAS and GIS benefits levels were just not enough for seniors to keep up with the cost of living, so we need to fix this now. Why is the government refusing to increase OAS and GIS benefits to lift seniors out of poverty on a permanent basis?\nHon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors): Mr. Chair, I want to thank my honourable colleague for giving me this opportunity to rise today and talk about how we are supporting Canadian seniors during this pandemic. Many Canadian seniors are facing significant health, economic and social challenges as a result of the pandemic. They built this country and now they need our help. Our government is taking significant action to provide Canadian seniors with greater financial security and give them the help they need during this crisis. We're building on past measures by introducing a one-time tax-free payment of $300 for those who receive OAS and of $200 for those receiving GIS, totalling $500 to seniors who receive both. We are also supporting community-based projects to improve the quality of life for seniors through the New Horizons for Seniors program, and investing in other charities. Seniors need our help, and we are delivering for them.\nMr. Scott Duvall: Mr. Chair, I was glad to hear that the Minister of Seniors is acknowledging the financial burden that our seniors are taking on. She mentioned the prescription dispensing fees, the added costs of their groceries and the delivery charges. I was glad that the Prime Minister acknowledged the heavy toll seniors are facing, and that they helped to shape this country and now they need our help. A surprising statement that I heard yesterday was the Treasury Board and the seniors minister's admission in their press briefing that the level of assistance being provided to Canadian seniors is quite low. Why is the seniors minister acknowledging all the burdens they're trying to help the seniors with, but the response they're giving is just a very low way of handling it?\nHon. Deb Schulte: I really do want to acknowledge my honourable colleague for his advocacy. I just want to assure him that while the government remains committed to implementing policies in our platform, we are focused on this health crisis right now. We have provided financial support to seniors sooner through the GST credit top-up, and now with additional payments to OAS and GIS recipients. This year we are investing over twice as much on financial assistance for seniors as we committed to in our platform, which is $3.8 billion compared to $1.56 billion in the platform. Seniors need our help and we're delivering. These payments have provided greater support for the most vulnerable seniors. Just to give some details, for those on OAS and GIS, they will get, in conjunction with the GST credit top-up, $875 per adult, and over $1,500 per couple. This is not an insignificant amount. This is a significant amount to support our seniors during this pandemic.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have about one minute left for both a question and a response. Go ahead, Mr. Duvall.\nMr. Scott Duvall: Thank you, Mr. Chair. The minister was talking about there being a maximum payment, if it's possible. What I've heard from seniors is this is a one-shot deal and it's an insult to them. They want some stability on an ongoing basis. We did make an agreement about two weeks ago that help would be implemented without delay on the seniors issue and for people with disabilities. Why did yesterday's announcement include only the people who are seniors, but not people with disabilities? Why have they been omitted? When can they expect help to come?\nHon. Deb Schulte: I just want to touch on the two points raised. On the one-time payment, we know that seniors need help now, and that's why it's important to get that money into seniors' accounts as soon as possible. That is why we're providing the one payment right away, instead of small amounts spread over months. In the coming weeks we will look at additional supports for other vulnerable Canadians. I just want to let him know we are working on additional measures.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now\nMr. Scott Duvall: I didn't hear anything about the disability\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The five minutes are finished.  It is now over to Mrs.Gill, the member for Manicouagan.\nMrs. Marilne Gill: Thank you, Mr.Chair. I'll be sharing my time with the member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques. I have just one question. It's for the government, and this will be the fourth time I've asked today. When I go back home, what am I going to tell the people of Chandler, Amqui, Bic, Saint-Simon, Tadoussac and Harrington Harbour? Am I going to tell them that the government supports the Bloc Qubcois's proposal? We propose giving seasonal workers access to employment insurance benefits until next season, regardless of whether they received the CERB, how many hours they worked or how many they accumulated. Should I instead tell them that the Liberal government has nothing in store for them as they suffer through the crisis? The government hasn't managed to bridge the employment insurance gap, and is even planning to bring it to six, if not eight, months. That means they'll have nothing to put on the dinner table for the next year. I'd like an answer, Mr.Chair.\nHon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I have three things to say in response to the member's important question. First, we obviously understand what she's saying. The work is seasonal, not the workers. The work they do is fundamental so they can support their families and their communities in eastern Quebec and other regions. Second, the CERB delivers significant assistance to those often vulnerable workers, the majority of whom would be able or certainly eager to find another job. Third, and finally, before any longer-term investments are made, it's important to keep in mind that those who may have received employment insurance benefits but who lost them in recent weeks or who do seasonal work are eligible for the CERB. That said, we are also looking ahead. We've already announced some very important measuresand we'll continue to do soin support of tourism, culture, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and many other key contributors to regional development in Quebec and elsewhere.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques, Mr.Blanchette-Joncas, has the floor.\nMr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: Mr.Chair, the situation my fellow member just described is of little comfort to those in Quebec's regions. To be frank, the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program is a flop. According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, one in three businesses doesn't qualify for rent relief because it doesn't meet the 70% drop in revenues requirement. Half of businesses have indicated that their landlords won't be applying for the program because it's optional. Commercial landlords can choose to participate in the program or not. How is that going to help businesses, Mr.Chair? We are still trying to figure that out. Businesses, especially seasonal ones, need more support to cover their fixed costs. Will the government commit to reviewing the program, which is too restrictive for businesses and optional for landlords? The program must do more to help businesses, particularly seasonal ones, cover their fixed costs.\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that businesses are, of course, very concerned about fixed costs. Our rent relief program is very significant. We haven't yet announced all the details, so it's much too soon to say that it's flawed. More information will be available in the next few days. At that point, we hope to be on the right track when it comes to fixed costs and rent.\nMr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: I hope you're making adjustments. It's totally unacceptable that only 10% of businesses who need the relief can get it. What's more, the public health crisis has brought its share of change for businesses, particularly with the new health measures. They have to plan, implement preventative measures, have response plans, train staff and acquire the necessary equipment. In order to do those things, protect the public and reopen their doors, businesses have to assume the costs. Will the government commit to providing financial assistance to businesses, especially those in the tourism industry, so they can cover the costs of putting the new health measures in place?\nHon. Navdeep Bains: I know the situation is very serious in rural communities. That's why we've invested $71million in community futures development corporations, or CFDCs, and business development centres. Both of those will go a long way towards helping businesses in rural communities, and I have no doubt that we will continue working together to find other solutions.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll move on to the honourable member for Calgary Centre, Mr. McLean.\nMr. Greg McLean (Calgary Centre, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. One of the terms for accessing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance, CECRA, is that you must have a mortgage on the property. One of the key terms of eligibility for this support is that the landlord owes money to a bank. Will the Minister of Finance tell us if this program was designed for the benefit of landlords and tenants or for the benefit of banks?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I appreciate the question from the member opposite. I think that it's important to know that commercial rent and landlord-tenant relationships are provincial jurisdictions. Therefore, as we embarked on an approach that could enable landlords and tenants to get to an agreement that would help both, we used the CMHC as a vehicle from which we could do that. We think that we've come up with a program that provides advantages for the landlords and advantages for the tenants, and we will be announcing details that will include how mortgages can be put in place for those landlords who don't currently have them.\nMr. Greg McLean: Brookfield Properties, a large Canadian firm, announced that its rent collections on commercial properties for April were 15% of the lease terms. Luckily, Brookfield has another company, Brookfield Business Partners, poised to help by buying up the distressed equity of the firms that owe them money. Did the Minister of Finance design CECRA with this outcome in mind, washing out individual investors and small companies and transferring that value into the hands of vulture financiers who hold all the cards?\nHon. Bill Morneau: In fact, Mr. Chair, we designed this program exactly with the idea in mind of the challenge that we're seeing. We're seeing that in many cases commercial tenants are not actually able to pay their rent, so landlords are not getting the rent that's due. Therefore, there's a mutual interest from tenants and from landlords in coming to an agreement. By providing funding through the mortgage system to those landlords, we recognize that we'll enable both of those two parts of the equation to come to an agreement that we think will be advantageous for the sector over the long term.\nMr. Greg McLean: In the past two months, the Bank of Canada has tripled the size of its balance sheet to almost $400 billion, with more to come, Mr. Chair. In the 2008 recession, the world's major economies endured quantitative easing on a previously unknown scale, most of which has not since been unwound. Canada endured a then-record $50-billion deficit, but we did not need to enter the uncertain world of QE, quantitative easing, as a result of the strength of Canada's oil and gas industry. Will the minister acknowledge that this government's oil and gas policy mismanagement has led to economic decline, necessitating hundreds of billions of dollars of quantitative easing?\nHon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, let me challenge one assumption implicit in the honourable member's question, the assumption that our government fails to understand the importance of the oil and gas sector to our economy. Let me quote some leaders from Alberta and their response to the lease program. Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said, I think this is essential. Not all companies are going to need to tap into this sort of liquidity...but some that are normally high-quality, stable companies likely will be looking for this program to provide a certain amount of liquidity for them. CAPP understands that we are supporting Canadian companies, including in the oil and gas sector, and I would urge the members opposite to understand that as well.\nMr. Greg McLean: BlackRock is one of the world's largest investment companies, managing trillions of dollars of bonds. It has lobbied regulators around the world to not be named a systemically important financial institution. The Bank of Canada unexpectedly engaged BlackRock as an adviser on its bond-buying plans. Is the Minister of Finance mindful of the conflict of interest that exists between the world's largest bond manager, BlackRock, and the advice it's giving the Bank of Canada on buying bonds?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member opposite might know that the Bank of Canada is independent from the government, and as such we are not privy to those decisions and support the continuing independence of the Bank of Canada from the government.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. McLean, you may have just a short question.\nMr. Greg McLean: The finance sector seems to be getting well served during this economic crisis. Will the minister endeavour to provide a more balanced program of benefits going forward for the sake of the entire Canadian economy, and not just the Brookfields, the BlackRocks and the big banks?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think the notion that one sector is being advantaged versus another actually defies the facts. More than 550,000 loans have gone out to small businesses in the form of $40,000 loans per business over a very short time period. Canada is a leader in this regard, and we'll continue to support businesses all across Canada with loans and support as they need it to get ourselves through this difficult time.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go to the last five-minute round. We'll begin with the honourable member for Carleton, Mr. Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Thank you, Mr. Chair. What is the dollar value of the total assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, earlier today we were given incorrect information on the Auditor General. I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government, and that is actually incorrect.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in fact, in the last full year of the Harper government, in 2014-15, the total spending on the Auditor General was $85.8 million.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in the most recent year, 2018-19, the total spend was $92.4 million for the Auditor General, showing a 7.7% increase.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would just say it's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to support Canadians through this time, with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is just the dollar value?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, that's a continuing commitment.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: I know we shouldn't ask the minister about numbers. He's just the finance minister, after all, but what is the equity on the Government of Canada's balance sheet?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong. There are three components to a balance sheet: the assets, the liabilities, and the equity. The minister doesn't know any of the three, so clearly he doesn't actually know anything about our balance sheet. That's reassuring. According to the Auditor General, the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Can the minister, if he is familiar with any of these numbers, tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $1 trillion of debt this year?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf. That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position, but we will continue to take that approach, which we think is the appropriate one.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Will it be $1 trillion, yes or no?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of our current national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of the national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: We have always seen, Mr. Chair, that these investments are not only supporting Canadians; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I will continue to focus our efforts, as we believe we should, on supporting Canadians through this time.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know what $1 trillion is?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge, supporting Canadians as we know we need to.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we know that by supporting Canadians, by continuing to make investments, we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Poilievre.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total debt, public and private, as a share of GDP in Canada?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they don't take on the debt themselves.\nHon. Pierre Poilievre: Yet they have. They have record household debt, record corporate debt and growing government debt. The finance minister doesn't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada, so I will give him one last chance. Based on his latest briefings, what is the total size of Canada's national debt? If he doesn't know, can he have the humility and honesty just to say so?\nHon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians. We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves. The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time, which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis. We think that's appropriate. We will continue to take that approach.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The hon. government House leader is rising on a point of order.\nHon. Pablo Rodriguez: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing, particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions. As the interpreters have already mentioned, they've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year. Mr.Chair, I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account. Thank you.\nThe Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions. Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting. This committee is now adjourned.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the Prime Minister say about fraud in distribution of funds?\nAnswer:",

I guess so . Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmarker} and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that {vocalsound} you were sort of waiting for them to {vocalsound} tell you that they had something for you and {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: and {vocalsound} they were sort of waiting for you and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh we ended up with this thing where they {disfmarker} they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that . So . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean it 's true that maybe {disfmarker} maybe no one really thought about that {disfmarker} that this latency thing would be such a {disfmarker} a strict issue\nPhD C: Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker} the other {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , {vocalsound} well , we discussed about that {disfmarker} about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and\nProfessor A: Then they couldn't . I see .\nPhD C: uh yeah . But there was also problem {disfmarker} perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Just talk more .\nPhD C: Yeah , slikes and send mails .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: u s o o Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh . OK .\nProfessor A: So there 's um {disfmarker} Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the {disfmarker} all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this {disfmarker} machines are busy and {vocalsound} you 're busy\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: and\nPhD C: Basically .\nProfessor A: Yeah . OK . Oh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Let 's {disfmarker} let 's , I mean , I think that as {disfmarker} as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there {disfmarker} there will be {vocalsound} uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that {vocalsound} it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's {vocalsound} approach or something and {vocalsound} in addition to {disfmarker} They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ?\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're {disfmarker} will start to do this also .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson {disfmarker} Ericsson code .\nPhD D: Yeah . We modif\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And\nPhD D: Yeah , I modified it {disfmarker} well , modifying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some {disfmarker} the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: But we haven't result until this moment .\nProfessor A: Yeah , sure .\nPhD D: But well , we are working in this also\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD D: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that it 's in process or that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it finished and it didn't get a good result ?\nPhD D: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature {disfmarker} the feature but the experiment have\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: we have not make the experiment\nProfessor A: Oh . OK .\nPhD D: and maybe will be good result or bad result , we don't know .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK . So um I suggest actually now we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sorta move on and {disfmarker} and hear what 's {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening in {disfmarker} in other areas like {vocalsound} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening with your {vocalsound} investigations {vocalsound} about echos and so on .\nGrad F: Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Uh {vocalsound} I also um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and {vocalsound} I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it sounded like um {vocalsound} the channel normalization part {vocalsound} um of his thesis um {vocalsound} was done in a {disfmarker} a bit of I don't know what the word is , a {disfmarker} a bit of a rough way um {vocalsound} it sounded like he um he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was {vocalsound} interesting for the test situation but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it 's {vocalsound} what I 'd wanna use so I have to {disfmarker} I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .\nProfessor A: OK . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,\nPhD D: It 's my\nPhD C: Oh yeah ?\nPhD D: I know this is mine here .\nProfessor A: so . OK . Um . {vocalsound} The um {disfmarker} so you , and then {vocalsound} you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the {disfmarker} the close mounted and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or I 'm hoping {disfmarker} I 'm hoping Espen will do it .\nProfessor A: Ah ! OK .\nGrad F: Um\nProfessor A: F um\nGrad F: u\nProfessor A: Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate .\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it .\nProfessor A: Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . {vocalsound} One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner {vocalsound} close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close {disfmarker} close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have {vocalsound} um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from {disfmarker} So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but {vocalsound} uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh {vocalsound} uh a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD B: Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?\nProfessor A: Yes .\nPhD B: Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,\nProfessor A: Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah .\nPhD B: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that {disfmarker} mmm uh {disfmarker} that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . {vocalsound} And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the {disfmarker} the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but {vocalsound} maybe just a quick reprise of {disfmarker} of what we were saying this morning .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor A: Uh .\nGrad E: Um . {comment} So continuing to um extend\nPhD B: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And {disfmarker} and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see .\nProfessor A: But that 's uh uh all {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} is a {disfmarker} a certainly relevant {comment} {vocalsound} uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: uh {vocalsound} what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found {disfmarker} finding useful\nPhD C: Hmm .\nProfessor A: um for {disfmarker}\nPhD B: And their {disfmarker} their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .\nProfessor A: Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad E: Oh yeah .\nProfessor A: There 's those {vocalsound} {pause} that uh yeah , some of {disfmarker} some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on {disfmarker} on uh {vocalsound} what \" good features \" are and {disfmarker}\nPhD B: What does {disfmarker} what did um Larry Saul use for {disfmarker} it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he {disfmarker} H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What {disfmarker} what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see .\nProfessor A: And the other thing you were talking about is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the {disfmarker} what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels {vocalsound} from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this {disfmarker} this database ? This is the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Hmm !\nProfessor A: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah .\nPhD B: Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice . Weld it . Zzz .\nProfessor A: Maybe you could go to these parlors and {disfmarker} and you could , you know {disfmarker} you know have {disfmarker} have , you know , reduced rates if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you can do the measurements .\nPhD B: Yeah . I That 's right . You could {disfmarker} what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science .\nPhD B: and Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD B: Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that {disfmarker} people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean {vocalsound} I can't remember where {disfmarker} uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of {disfmarker} Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I can't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting .\nProfessor A: Do you mean eh {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Mar\nPhD C: Well he was the guy {disfmarker} the guy that was using {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: you mean when was {disfmarker} was Mark Randolph there , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: Mark Randolph .\nProfessor A: Yeah he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's at Motorola now .\nPhD B: Oh is he ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know {disfmarker} I just remember it had to do with you know {vocalsound} uh positional parameters\nPhD C: What {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD B: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So the only {disfmarker} the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there {disfmarker} What you really want are these binary {pause} labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um {vocalsound} if you did something instead that {disfmarker} like um having some manual annotation by {vocalsound} uh you know , linguistics students , this would {disfmarker} there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with {disfmarker} with John before\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And then there would {disfmarker} it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is {vocalsound} boot trying to {disfmarker} to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from {vocalsound} uh the uh {vocalsound} uh the data itself there , but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Could you cluster the {disfmarker} just do some kind of clustering ?\nProfessor A: Guess you could , yeah .\nPhD B: Bin them up into different categories and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Yeah . So anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} I mean in general it 's gonna be {disfmarker} for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to {vocalsound} wear the pellets and {disfmarker} Um . So .\nGrad E: Right . Right .\nPhD B: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD B: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the true mappings are for each phone ?\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: I see .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in {disfmarker} in my mind , I guess , is that um {vocalsound} we 're looking at different ways that we can combine {vocalsound} uh different kinds of {disfmarker} of rep front - end representations {vocalsound} um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from {vocalsound} uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have {vocalsound} a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that {vocalsound} to change some of the other methods we have , since {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a {disfmarker} a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than {vocalsound} um just assuming {vocalsound} that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength {vocalsound} towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it {disfmarker} so um {vocalsound} he 's got these um uh uh\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: he \" AND 's \" between these different {vocalsound} features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in {disfmarker} in principle {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different {disfmarker} soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh {vocalsound} multi - band channels . And um {vocalsound} the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" {disfmarker} \" AND ' ed \" things {vocalsound} is something that 's kept {vocalsound} uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is {disfmarker} is uh {vocalsound} taking {vocalsound} the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nPhD B: So he doesn't have {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: which means that it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's uh i It could be for instance {vocalsound} that for a particular point in the data {vocalsound} you don't want to um uh train a particular band {disfmarker} train the detectors for a particular band . You {disfmarker} you wanna ignore {vocalsound} that band , cuz that 's a {disfmarker} Ban - band is a noisy {disfmarker} noisy measure .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And we don't {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well {disfmarker} well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .\nPhD B: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or {disfmarker} Ho\nGrad E: F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .\nProfessor A: Well at the {disfmarker} at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's {disfmarker} where it 's sonorant . But he 's {disfmarker} but what he 's - but what he 's not training up {disfmarker} uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\nGrad E: Right . For the full band .\nProfessor A: um I guess one way of describing would be if {disfmarker} if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor A: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . OK .\nProfessor A: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band {vocalsound} towards making your decision . And um {vocalsound} uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should {disfmarker} you should use everything {vocalsound} uh with {disfmarker} with uh equal strength .\nPhD B: I see .\nProfessor A: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had {vocalsound} uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the {disfmarker} if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from {disfmarker} from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: So where did he get his {disfmarker} uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?\nGrad E: From uh canonical mappings {comment} um at first\nPhD B: OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: and then it 's unclear um eh\nPhD B: Using TIMIT ? or using {disfmarker}\nGrad E: using TIMIT\nPhD B: Uh - huh .\nGrad E: right , right .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of {vocalsound} iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this {disfmarker} cuz then whatever {vocalsound} that alignment is , it 's that for all {disfmarker} all bands .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate {disfmarker} tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still {vocalsound} not quite the same because then it 's {disfmarker} it 's um setting targets based on where you would say {vocalsound} the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a {vocalsound} soft {disfmarker} soft target uh {vocalsound} uh embedded {vocalsound} neural net training like we 've done a few times uh {vocalsound} f the forward um {disfmarker} do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?\nPhD B: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .\nProfessor A: Oh . You 're playing ?\nPhD B: I um Huh ?\nProfessor A: You 're playing ?\nPhD B: Yes , I 'm playing . Um {vocalsound} so I wanted to do this experiment to see um {vocalsound} uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um {disfmarker} I think I sent around last week a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where {vocalsound} I would take the um {disfmarker} the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for {vocalsound} the ICSI - OGI front - end .\nProfessor A: What {disfmarker} which test set was this ?\nPhD B: This is {disfmarker} that I looked at ?\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh {vocalsound} been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK {vocalsound} system for the Italian data and got the same results that um {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} Stephane had . So um I started looking {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to {disfmarker} uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use {vocalsound} the same number of states for all of the models\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but for the {disfmarker} most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So {vocalsound} it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's {disfmarker} because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific {vocalsound} um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the {disfmarker} for the longer word ,\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but .\nPhD B: Yeah so I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create {vocalsound} uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um {disfmarker} how these models were coming out , you know , what w {vocalsound} when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the {disfmarker} uh what do the transition probabilities look like {disfmarker} in the self - loops , {comment} look like in {disfmarker} in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can {vocalsound} calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did {disfmarker} quickly , I did the silence model and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the {vocalsound} string of digits .\nProfessor A: Wow . Lots of silence .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I {disfmarker} I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their model for a whole digit string is silence {vocalsound} digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .\nProfessor A: Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?\nPhD B: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD B: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own {disfmarker} um It doesn't require its own training data ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: it just shares that state .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know {vocalsound} how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the {disfmarker} the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of {disfmarker} just from looking at the {vocalsound} durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did the professor think about improving the back recognizer for the Aurora task?\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": "The professor thought that the back recognizer was not very good and that it should be improved.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nThe above example shows that the system can be used to answer questions about the content of a meeting transcript.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe system is not perfect. For example, it does not handle the case where the answer to a question is a list of items. In this case, the system will return the first item in the list.\n\n\\section{Future Work}\n\nThe system can be improved in a number of ways. For example, the system can be extended to handle questions that are not about the content of the meeting transcript. For example, the system can be extended to answer questions about the meeting transcript such as ``Who was the first person to speak?'' or ``Who was the last person to speak?''\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nThe system described in this paper is a first step towards a system that can answer questions about the content of a meeting transcript. The system is not perfect. For example, it does not handle the case where the answer to a question is a list of items. In this case, the system will return the first item in the list.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\n\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number CCF-0910375.",

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nUser Interface: .. .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Maybe not . Anyway ,\nUser Interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh\nProject Manager: S so any any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .\nProject Manager: Is i {gap} not at this point .\nUser Interface: Not at this point .\nProject Manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nMarketing: I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um so yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: And more about yourself , you're from ?\nMarketing: Um I'm from Leicester ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I like sports {vocalsound} um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: um {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But not with rabbits . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: not with rabbits , no no .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: And vets , I like vets as well .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing: Okay ? Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .\nProject Manager: There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: mm {vocalsound} hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's not bad at all .\nProject Manager: Ah it looks like a dog .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side .\nUser Interface: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And where where are you from ?\nUser Interface: I'm from Estonia\nProject Manager: Estonia .\nUser Interface: uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good luck .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that'll do .\nMarketing: and then just some horns .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so let let me draw the body first .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and they've got a long tail\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and a long face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's eating .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And there is some grass there .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Horns ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass ,\nMarketing: draw some horns . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they do not disturb anybody um\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , here's a space .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It looks very very cute .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I like the cow .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: I'm Jen .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I like {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing: Is that a lizard ?\nIndustrial Designer: No way . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Wow .\nProject Manager: It's a gecko .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah okay .\nUser Interface: Ah , a gecko , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Is there a difference ?\nUser Interface: Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard .\nUser Interface: yeah , they are\nProject Manager: And I I like geckos\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nProject Manager: I don't like snakes . I come from Australia\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\nUser Interface: Wonderful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I've just thought {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you right click on it you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally {vocalsound} as {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got {disfmarker} um we're planning to sell these remote controls for {disfmarker} let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What are the target price, target cost and target profit of remote control when discussing the design of the remote control?\nAnswer:",

We have to evaluate the product yet .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Sorry .\nMarketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Criteria .\nMarketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm .\nProject Manager: No , it's okay .\nMarketing: Well , uh we can't do that .\nIndustrial Designer: I'll get it .\nProject Manager: Oh , it's okay .\nMarketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item .\nProject Manager: What do you think ?\nMarketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six .\nProject Manager: {gap} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry , six .\nMarketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , true or false .\nMarketing: And you {gap} true or false .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\nMarketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Sorry .\nProject Manager: You ?\nUser Interface: Three .\nProject Manager: Me too . So it's a three .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\nUser Interface: Mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .\nProject Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's uh a six .\nIndustrial Designer: Five .\nUser Interface: Mm , four .\nProject Manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think it's four .\nUser Interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: but\nProject Manager: Yes . So , I think it's four .\nUser Interface: older {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .\nProject Manager: Okay . Give it a four .\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm .\nProject Manager: We put the fashion in electronics .\nMarketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .\nIndustrial Designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . Two .\nProject Manager: Uh , I say uh a five .\nMarketing: Two .\nProject Manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't .\nIndustrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion .\nProject Manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Then make it th three .\nMarketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too .\nProject Manager: No . Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay . Three is okay .\nMarketing: Yeah , agree ?\nProject Manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A three .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .\nIndustrial Designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it .\nProject Manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Say two .\nMarketing: Two or three ?\nProject Manager: Okay , two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Two . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You ?\nUser Interface: One . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Me too . One .\nMarketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yes . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah . Yellow .\nProject Manager: I don't think so .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Looks like a pistol .\nProject Manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\nProject Manager: No . It won't get lost .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It won't .\nProject Manager: A one ? {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , o one .\nProject Manager: Okay , a one .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: Next .\nMarketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\nProject Manager: {gap}\nMarketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\nProject Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Me too .\nProject Manager: That was our target . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ? Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel .\nMarketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T\nIndustrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yes , a one .\nProject Manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I think s two is better .\nUser Interface: Yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Two is okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Two .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nMarketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .\nProject Manager: No , it's new . Innovation .\nMarketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nMarketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three .\nProject Manager: {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm , three .\nProject Manager: Me too . Three .\nMarketing: A three .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating .\nProject Manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .\nMarketing: So , we will do that . Yes .\nProject Manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\nMarketing: By nine .\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two .\nProject Manager: Yep .\nMarketing: Come on . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , nah . Okay .\nMarketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , it's good .\nMarketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Thank you .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , I think {gap} .\nMarketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And I closed your slide-show .\nProject Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .\nProject Manager: Yep . Next please .\nMarketing: Next . Finance .\nProject Manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cheapest there is .\nProject Manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .\nIndustrial Designer: Expensive .\nProject Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , it's the most advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced .\nIndustrial Designer: Advanced .\nProject Manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .\nUser Interface: Mm , yes .\nProject Manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\nIndustrial Designer: One .\nMarketing: One .\nProject Manager: And it's not really a s\nIndustrial Designer: Joystick uh thing .\nMarketing: {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh\nProject Manager: So , we have to change something .\nIndustrial Designer: What what are the costs ?\nProject Manager: Fifteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen .\nProject Manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour .\nMarketing: {gap} . We would have uh n\nIndustrial Designer: A special colour .\nProject Manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\nProject Manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\nMarketing: For a remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} What ?\nMarketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\nProject Manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?\nProject Manager: That's one Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .\nProject Manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?\nProject Manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh .\nProject Manager: Then it's not good anymore .\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yellow rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , normal .\nIndustrial Designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .\nProject Manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think .\nProject Manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\nIndustrial Designer: No . Uh , no , no , no .\nProject Manager: Or it's then a regular ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait .\nMarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ .\nMarketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date .\nMarketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ?\nProject Manager: Mm , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Then it's okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Huh . No knew that .\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .\nProject Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,\nUser Interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .\nIndustrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?\nUser Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Now it's {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Very good .\nMarketing: No .\nProject Manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: About the\nProject Manager: About the project .\nMarketing: Project .\nIndustrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope .\nProject Manager: Okay . And you .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .\nProject Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No .\nProject Manager: So , it's good for the speed .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: So , I think we're ready .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Beer .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: is the penultim meeting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: How was lunch ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Don't be sarcastic . {vocalsound} Mark . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\nMarketing: Uh Rama .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro .\nProject Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing . It's {disfmarker} So , let's go . First with Rama . Participant two .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , participant two . Component .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\nMarketing: What is a double-curved shape ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: Why ?\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\nMarketing: The cost .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nProject Manager: Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm like this ?\nProject Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay . {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: rubber is expensive\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: And this push buttons\nProject Manager: Uh yeah so\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nProject Manager: Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .\nIndustrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S\nMarketing: Speech {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , and still we have {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?\nMarketing: L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh l\nMarketing: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh\nUser Interface: No ,\nIndustrial Designer: it's like a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , so let's try it , let's t\nIndustrial Designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or {gap} or something so we want to reduce the cost on display\nMarketing: {gap} The L_C_D_ would {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: or this inter\nMarketing: The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .\nMarketing: Just uh for output , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: because like it won't take much money I guess ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: because {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , yep .\nProject Manager: {gap} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: You have any further questions or ?\nMarketing: I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: for really light batteries and with uh good price .\nMarketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be {disfmarker} ask .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology\nProject Manager: Okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: for the location . Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . So let's now go to the {disfmarker} you don't have more question ?\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: No , it's okay .\nProject Manager: Um mm thank you mm .\nUser Interface: No more questions .\nIndustrial Designer: Yep . Thank you .\nMarketing: Puts less of constraint on what we can do\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: but\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: it's always like that . We have dreams and the {disfmarker} in the end we find out that it's not feasible . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh . We have uh some limitations {gap} . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Anyway . {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice ,\nMarketing: L_C_D_ .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: L_C_ {vocalsound}\nMarketing: L_S_D_ is something else ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and it's quite nice as well . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I'm an artist , sorry . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So ,\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} yeah .\nUser Interface: So uh , that's not {disfmarker}\nMarketing: go on uh artist . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope that's not too much .\nProject Manager: Now let's talk about uh interface .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh participant number three .\nProject Manager: Three .\nIndustrial Designer: Three .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh\nProject Manager: Which one ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: mm mm uh have a look at this {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: no it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {gap} Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and uh we got explanation for every button\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no {gap} ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Let's change millenniums . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: maybe you can use {gap} in the end and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap} doesn't make sense . This is very {vocalsound} ugly .\nUser Interface: Really ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I thought you like it . Ah okay\nMarketing: Oh no ,\nUser Interface: just press the button , please uh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: too much concept .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But instead of this I will devise {disfmarker} That's our concept .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Ah , back today . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nUser Interface: And uh what will people say ? They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {gap} Do you think it can come in several colours ?\nUser Interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied .\nMarketing: Or did the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .\nMarketing: Um but not the case .\nUser Interface: Not the case .\nMarketing: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .\nMarketing: Mm yeah , okay ,\nUser Interface: Do you like it ?\nMarketing: so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it's uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but I don't use that but again , uh I might {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: That's why you don't have it . That's why ,\nMarketing: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: 'cause it's nasty . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .\nUser Interface: No .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we can just {disfmarker} if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .\nUser Interface: Um , I am here .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: So users have different {disfmarker} I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So ?\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So we can just {disfmarker} if they want they can just pay another two Euro .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , okay , so\nUser Interface: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we {disfmarker} if you want o more colours {vocalsound} on L_C_D_ ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Kind of upgradable uh {vocalsound} remote control .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Wow , wow .\nIndustrial Designer: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours .\nUser Interface: Okay , what uh {disfmarker} there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um {vocalsound} 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,\nIndustrial Designer: Lights , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Like a chameleon .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: We can make it in fact .\nProject Manager: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .\nUser Interface: If if if the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: okay .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an {disfmarker} a gradable version ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nProject Manager: but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but {disfmarker} and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} And that makes me special .\nProject Manager: Okay\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of {vocalsound} uh o or this is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .\nProject Manager: Okay , so\nMarketing: Those who wanted to have it pink .\nProject Manager: so {vocalsound} i it's not uh a s base service\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No mm no .\nProject Manager: it's a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: {gap} be an option ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: yeah .\nMarketing: It might be optional , yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can {gap} those {disfmarker}\nMarketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah .\nMarketing: Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So m so\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: maybe that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} And you'll be different .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} And it makes you different ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: you know ?\nMarketing: You always have your remote .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . {vocalsound} Want to change my neighbour .\nUser Interface: Anyone has their remote controls here ?\nMarketing: Oh , you don't ? {vocalsound} Yeah . You don't have your remo {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: No ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . {vocalsound} Uh it's white\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look {gap} which people seems to like {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: just because it's {vocalsound} a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?\nMarketing: Seems important .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light ,\nMarketing: Mm {gap} glow in the dark ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nMarketing: so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so that like {disfmarker} at least um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Iradium ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ah sorry . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: that {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So mm {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay . S well ,\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: let's go on maybe with the presentation .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And um the remote control's going to be smart\nIndustrial Designer: Oh .\nUser Interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: And uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I dunno\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that's a question to you and to mm to {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .\nUser Interface: Okay , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I dunno . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm , that's a nice world . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So just just just just think about it um .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} Thank you .\nMarketing: Don't touch the remote .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .\nUser Interface: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .\nMarketing: Like with some {disfmarker} Maybe fingerprint recognition or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker} Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh that {disfmarker} mm that could be feasible I guess , like {disfmarker} So since we have {disfmarker} we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay . So it could be smart in that way .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . Okay .\nMarketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh {disfmarker} things like that\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , sure .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: I dunno , that might be expensive\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: but\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} The remote that knows you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , thanks .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: My turn ?\nProject Manager: yeah , Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: {gap} Okay , it's alright .\nProject Manager: Participant two ?\nIndustrial Designer: Four .\nProject Manager: Four ,\nMarketing: Four , I think .\nProject Manager: sorry .\nMarketing: Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on {vocalsound} how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people {gap} have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So anyway uh next slide please . {vocalsound} Uh to be to be quick {vocalsound} there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are {disfmarker} uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very {disfmarker} pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nMarketing: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh {vocalsound} it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Next slide please .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so {disfmarker} currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of {vocalsound} of look or feel\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or so . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And I think of course uh {vocalsound} i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . {vocalsound} It it can travel f from clothe to furniture {vocalsound} same idea .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . {vocalsound} And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: What is spongy ?\nMarketing: yeah . Well\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah\nMarketing: this {vocalsound} so so I think uh uh i\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} kind of um maybe {disfmarker} {gap}\nMarketing: When we were talking about rubber ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {gap} We need to think about {disfmarker} mm mm .\nMarketing: Seems not , seems not .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} sorry Mark .\nMarketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It seems to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,\nIndustrial Designer: Fruit . Even shape ?\nMarketing: as a {disfmarker} even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} More {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Mm .\nProject Manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} You're old-fashioned .\nMarketing: So that's what people seem to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought\nProject Manager: Sorry . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but that's that's fashion and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay that's all I have to say .\nProject Manager: Mm you have questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: These {disfmarker} I'm sorry .\nIndustrial Designer: This {disfmarker} you you {gap} so did you {gap} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course ,\nIndustrial Designer: Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends\nIndustrial Designer: It's not from {disfmarker} mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: that are also {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: It's more general trend\nMarketing: well .\nIndustrial Designer: it's not particular to the remote control .\nMarketing: No , it's not it's not {disfmarker} this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nMarketing: The {disfmarker} what we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy\nMarketing: Sure .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah yeah .\nMarketing: We have to {disfmarker} I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: but we still have to put our chips inside , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of course .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah\nMarketing: This is your problem .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that {disfmarker} yeah yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} This is not mine . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , looking {disfmarker} yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape\nMarketing: Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material .\nIndustrial Designer: or at least {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If if it's something like rubber made or {disfmarker} I think it it's also going to be good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} No more question ? Okay .\nMarketing: Yep . Thanks .\nProject Manager: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Look and feel de\nProject Manager: um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . {vocalsound} Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm . Hmm .

Since it knows who was using it, it might record the kind of channels that you often watched and the level of volumes you liked. In other words, it would provide your way of using it. This would be a good sales pitch though it might be expensive."
