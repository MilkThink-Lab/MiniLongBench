The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nFatted calf\nFatted calf is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\nQuestion:\n\"In the Bible, whose return heralded the killing of \"\"the fatted calf\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nLoving Father\nPassage:\nKingdom of the Algarve\nThe Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalusغرب الأندلس), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIt was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. \nIn actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. \n\nThe title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nReconquista\n\nDuring the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.\n\nFirst conquest\n\nIn 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.\n\nThe conquest of Algarve\n\nWith the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, Mûsâ Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahfûz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.\n\nAben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. \n\nThe Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.\n\nThe entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.\n\nThe issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\nDuring the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve served as the location for the embarkment for many voyages, mainly those funded by the Infante D. Henrique. Prince Henry also set up his famous school of navigation at Sagres Point, though the idea of a real school building and campus is highly disputed. Most of the voyages set sail from Lagos.\n\nThe Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\n\nThe name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of Algarve. John I of Portugal added to the title of \"King of Portugal and the Algarve\", the title \"Lord of Ceuta\", and his grandson Afonso V of Portugal, in turn, styled himself \"Lord of Ceuta and Alcacer-Ceguer in Africa\" (after 1458). The 1471 conquest of Asilah, Tangiers and Larache, together with North African previous holdings, led to the creation of the title \"the Algarves from either side of the sea in Africa\", leaving the European Algarve to become \"the Algarve behind the sea.\"\n\nThus, it was not until 1471 that \"the Kingdom of the Algarve\" led to \"the Kingdom of the Algarves\", due to the increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa, which were made as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: \"Kings of Portugal and the Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa\". The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: Mazagão; lost by Portugal in 1769).\n\n19th century conflicts\n\nDuring the 19th century, a serious clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus of people from the Algarvian inlands to the coastal cities. José Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, and fought in the inlands and attacked the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve and Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Remexido, however, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838.\nQuestion:\n\"In which country is the area called \"\"the Algarve\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nPortogało\nPassage:\nNanosecond\nA nanosecond (ns) is a SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 or 1/1,000,000,000 s). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.71 years.\n\nThe word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second. Its symbol is ns.\n\nA nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or  microsecond.  Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 and 10 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.\n\nTimes of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics.\n\nLight travels exactly 29.9792458  centimeters in 1 nanosecond. This is equivalent to 11.8 inches, leading some to refer to a nanosecond as a light-foot.  A light-foot is actually ~1.0167033621639674471063578257196 nanoseconds. \nThe earliest use of the term is by George Gamow.  Another early reference commonly given  is to Admiral Grace Hopper, who used to give out pieces of wire about a foot long to illustrate the eventual problem of building very high speed computers.   If it takes light a nanosecond to go a foot (in a vacuum, slower in copper), then a computer built with parts connected by half this distance, 15 cm of wire, would take at least a nanosecond to send data to a part and get a response.  The solution, developed in Hopper's lifetime, was first the integrated circuit and later the multi-core processor.\n\n\"Once she presented a piece of wire about a foot long, and explained that it represented a nanosecond, since it was the maximum distance electricity could travel in wire in one-billionth of a second. She often contrasted this nanosecond with a microsecond - a coil of wire nearly a thousand feet long - as she encouraged programmers not to waste even a microsecond.\"\n\nCommon measurements \n\n* 0.5 nanoseconds (0.5 ns) – the average life of a molecule of positronium hydride\n* 1.0 nanosecond – cycle time for radio frequency 1 GHz (1 hertz), an inverse unit.

It is still used for special occasions.\n\nTo \"lay a hāngi\" or \"put down a hāngi\" involves digging a pit in the ground, heating stones in the pit with a large fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering (or lifting) the hāngi. \n\nThere are many variations and details that can be altered. Hāngi \"experts\" have developed and improved methods that often, like the stones themselves, have been handed down for generations. Another name sometimes used is umu, for instance the umu tī, used in the South Island to cook Cabbage trees (Cordyline australis). \n\nThe evolution of hāngi methods \n\nEvidence from early Polynesian settler sites in New Zealand such as Wairau Bar and in coastal Otago Peninsula from about 1280 shows a significant number of large cooking pits or umu which were designed to cook Ti-pore or various species of Cordyline. This was a common east Polynesian practice in the Cook Islands and Society Islands. The remains of large umu have also been found in the Kermadec Islands. The .900 long, carrot shaped tap root was cooked in a large stone lined pit for between 1 and 2 days. Various sources say it was baked while some say steamed. The result was a fibrous mass of sweet pulp that had a bitter after taste. Investigation in Otago shows that most pits were used only once or perhaps twice before making a new pit. Some sources say the longer the cooking, the sweeter the pulp. This may have been due to the evaporation of the water content. The distinguishing feature of a Ti- pore was its large size compared to a normal cooking earth oven.  \nPrior to colonisation and the introduction of metals and wire, food was laid out on clean sticks, bark, large leaves and other vegetation to minimize direct contact with the hot rocks and reduce burning. Carved bowls and flat rocks were also used for this purpose.\nLeaves, sticks and vegetation were used to cover the food and to prevent crushing from the weight of the earth on top.\n\nMany different hāngi methods are now used. Wire baskets became widely used in the early 19th century with sacking and cloth replacing leaves and bark as the covering of choice. Red hot iron or steel may be used in addition to or instead of stones.\n\nIn the early 21st century, gas heated stainless steel \"hāngi machines\" are sometimes used to replicate the style of cooking without the need for a wood fire, rocks and a pit.\nQuestion:\nHangi is a traditional New Zealand Maori method of cooking using a?\nAnswer:\nPit\nPassage:\nPholadidae\nPholadidae, known as piddocks or angelwings, are a family of bivalve mollusc similar to a clam.\n\nBackground\n\nPidocks are unique in that each side of their shells is divided into 2 or 3 separate sections. Furthermore, one of the piddock's shells has a set of ridges or \"teeth\", which they use to grind away at clay or soft rock and create tubular burrows. The shape of these burrows is due to the rotating motion of the piddock as it grinds the rock to make its home. The piddock stays in the burrow it digs for the entirety of its eight-year lifespan, with only its siphon exposed to take in water that it filters for food. When the piddock dies and leaves an empty tubular burrow, other marine life such as sea anemone, crabs and other molluscs may use the burrow.\n\nSome species of Pholadidae may reach up to 18 cm (7″). Their coloration is typically white, though through consumption of red tide algae some may develop a pink coloration.\n\n* The angelwing species Cyrtopleura costata has approximately 26 radiating ribs. Growth lines run horizontally over the surface of the shell. Angelwings have a spoon-shaped brace under the beak of the shell, called the apophysis, where the mollusc's foot muscles are attached. Cyrtopleura costata possesses long siphons which protrude from its burrow and circulate water as the source for its food supply. It cannot retract its siphons into the protection of its shell, so the two valves can never shut completely. The muscles fusing the shell's valves together are weak, making it rare to find angelwings with both halves still intact. Some shell hunters dig for the living clam, and if dug up, the fragile shell must be placed immediately into a container of water or it will close and shatter. The angelwing's shell is popular with collectors, as well as a delicious food staple. The angelwing lives offshore and in estuaries, sometimes as much as a metre (three feet) deep in the mud or clay.\n* The Atlantic mud-piddock, Barnea truncata, often referred to as the fallen angelwing, is classed among the angelwing varieties, growing up to 5.7 cm (2¼″) and is similar to other angelwings but with weaker sculpture. One end is squared off and the other end pointed. Loose accessory plates are located above the hinge on live specimens. It possesses a white exterior and interior. It burrows into mud, clay or softwood. Occasionally it is washed onto sounds and ocean beaches, and has a habitat range from Maine to Brazil. This fragile shell is rarely dug from mud without breaking. It burrows deeply and has long, united siphons.\n* The false angelwing Petricola pholadiformis, is also classed among varieties of angelwing, growing up to 7 cm (2¾″). It has a thin, elongate shell resembling a small angelwing but lacks the rolled-out hinge area. Its beak is at one end of the shell with strong radial ribbing on the beak end. Teeth are located on hinge and a deep pallial sinus and partially united siphons. It has a white exterior and interior. It typically burrows into hard surfaces such as clay or peat in intertidal zones. It is commonly found on sounds and ocean beaches with a range from Canada to Uruguay.\n* The common piddock (Pholas dactylus) is known for its bioluminescence[http://www.marlin.ac.uk/species/Pholasdactylus.htm Basic information for Pholas dactylus (Common piddock)]  and was investigated by Raphaël Dubois in his 1887 discovery of luciferin.\n\nGenera and selected species\n\n* Genus Barnea Risso, 1826\n** Barnea candida Linnaeus, 1758\n** Barnea fragilis\n** Barnea manilensis (Philippi, 1847)\n** Barnea parva Pennant, 1777\n** Barnea similis (Gray, 1835)\n** Barnea subtruncata (G.

It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in\nthe parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.\n\nHistory\n\nThe small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century.  The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription οὐ φροντὶς (\"Why Worry\"). It is now a Grade II* listed building as \"Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)\"; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015. \n\nLawrence first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby Bovington Camp with the Tank Corps.  He made it habitable with the help of a friend, then bought it in 1925 and used it as a holiday home. He described it as an earthly paradise and wrote \"Nothing in Clouds Hill is to be a care upon the world. While I have it there shall be nothing exquisite or unique in it. Nothing to anchor me.\" The cottage had no electric lights and three living rooms, described as an eating room, book room and music room. For heat insulation Lawrence had the eating room lined with asbestos that was covered in aluminium foil, and he kept his food under glass domes. In the book room he installed a large leather divan, and in the music room above it he had his gramophone \"with a huge amplifier horn\", a leather sofa and chair.\n\nIn 1935 Lawrence left the Royal Air Force and lived at Clouds Hill. A few weeks later, at the age of 46, he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident close to the cottage, and died in the Bovington Camp hospital on 19 May 1935. The following year, his heir, his brother A. W. Lawrence gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust. It is now a museum, dedicated to Lawrence. It is open to visitors from the end of March to the beginning of October, Thursday – Sunday.\n\nThe cottage remains largely as Lawrence left it at his death.  It features an exhibition detailing Lawrence's life, and most of his original furniture and possessions. The cottage reflects his complex personality and links to the Middle East.\n\nThe circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place. \n\nSleeping bags\n\nLawrence reserved a sleeping bag for guests and visitors who stayed overnight. In 1965 it was stolen. The bag's disappearance coincided with the release of Lawrence of Arabia, the film which popularised his story and it was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity and excitement generated by the film.\n\nIn 2001, the sleeping bag was returned. The Independent reported: \n\n\"The sleeping bag that served as a guest bed to some of the 20th century's most distinguished authors at TE Lawrence's weekend retreat has been returned 36 years after it was stolen. National Trust custodians of Clouds Hill, the author's cottage in Dorset, were amazed when a weather-beaten package from Belgium arrived containing the sleeping bag, along with a sheepish note that read: 'This is yours'. The bag, embroidered with the word 'tuum' ['yours'], was provided for guests at the cottage, while Lawrence slept on the floor in the other sleeping bag, marked 'meum' ['mine']. According to Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence's biographer, tuum's occupants included George Bernard Shaw, E. M.

Some versions are sculpted or slashed into a pattern resembling an ear of wheat.\n\nHistory and etymology\n\nIn ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flatbread baked in the ashes of the hearth (focus in Latin).  This became a diverse range of breads that include focaccia in Italian cuisine, hogaza in Spain, fogassa in Catalonia, fugàssa in Ligurian, pogača in the Balkans, pogácsa in Hungary, fougasse in Provence (originally spelled fogatza), fouace or fouée in other French regions and on the Channel Islands.  The Provence version is more likely to have additions in the form of olives, cheese, or anchovies, which may be regarded as a primitive form of pizza without the tomato.\n\nThere is also in Portugal the fogaça, a sweet bread. In Brazil, pão sovado is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as pão francês or pão-de-sal), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called pão suíço. They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil.\n\nFougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded.\n\nFougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts.\n\nUse in dishes\n\nIt is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread. Other variations include dried fruit, Roquefort and nuts or olives and goat cheese. It is known by extension as a fougasse even though it is more a sandwich than just a type of bread.\nQuestion:\nFougasse, associated with Provence, is what type of food?\nAnswer:\nSomun\nPassage:\nWaterborne diseases\nWaterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the World Health Organization, such diseases account for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene. \n\nOverview\n\nThe term \"waterborne disease\" is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease as \"waterborne\". Nor is it common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as \"waterborne\" just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors.\n\nMicroorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria, many of which are intestinal parasites, or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses. (In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as \"organisms\", it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection.)\n\nYet other important classes of water-borne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda, that is to say \"roundworms\". As an example of water-borne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus, becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease. \n\nAnother class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae, a family of blood flukes. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people world-wide. \n\nLong before modern studies had established the germ theory of disease, or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favouring processed beverages such as beer, wine and tea. For example, in the camel caravans that crossed Central Asia along the Silk Road, the explorer Owen Lattimore noted, \"The reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet.\" \n\nSocioeconomic impact\n\nWaterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by e.g. costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected. \n\nInfections by type of pathogen \n\nProtozoan \n\nParasitic \n\nBacterial \n\n*\n\nViral \n\n*\n\nAlgal \n\n*\nQuestion:\nThe devastating water-borne disease Schistosomiasis, or Snail Fever, is more commonly called what?\nAnswer:\nGenital schistosomiasis\nPassage:\nRochebaron\nRochebaron is a soft blue cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk, in the town of Beauzac in the Auvergne region, in the Massif Central, France.\n\nThis cheese is one of several that are made by curdling milk and separating the curds from the whey.

St. Alban was the first English martyr. Meanings, definition and origins - a patron is considered to be a defender of a specific group of people or of a nation. There is a patron for virtually every cause, profession or special interest. Prayers are considered more likely to be answered by asking a patron for intercession on their behalf. St. Alban is represented by a sword and a fountain, because, when he reached the summit of the hill where he was to be beheaded, he prayed for water to quench his thirst, and immediately a spring appeared at his feet. His burial-place was afterwards revealed to King Offa, who erected a shrine over his remains at what is now St. Albans, in Hertfordshire.\nWhy is Saint Alban the patron of Converts and refugees?\nWhy is Saint Alban is the patron of Converts and refugees? St Alban was a Roman soldier who was converted to the Christian faith and became the the first English martyr for his convictions.\nDeath of Saint Alban\nThere are two categories of saints: martyrs and confessors.

Cause of Death - he was Beheaded. \nHow Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art\nIt is helpful to be able to recognise Saint Alban in paintings, stained glass windows, illuminated manuscripts, architecture and other forms of Christian art. The artistic representations reflect the life or death of saints, or an aspect of life with which the person is most closely associated. Saint Alban is represented in Christian Art with a sword and a fountain.\nFeast Day of Saint Alban\nThe Feast Day of Saint Alban is June 22nd. The origin of Feast Days: most saints have specially designated feast days and are associated with a specific day of the year and these are referred to as the saint's feast day.

The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was originally administered by the International Women's Cricket Council until the two associations merged in 2005. The first tournament was held in England in 1973, two years before the first men's tournament.\n\nParticipation in the tournament has varied through the eight competitions: fifteen different teams have played, but only Australia, England and New Zealand have appeared in every tournament. India have appeared in all but two of the competitions. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Young England have all appeared in just one tournament: in each case, the first competition, in 1973.\n\nThe most recent tournament, the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, was held in India for the third time in February. In the final Australia beat West Indies by 114 runs at the Brabourne Stadium.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst World Cup\n\nWomen's international cricket was first played in 1934, when a party from England toured Australia and New Zealand. The first Test match was played on 28–31 December 1934, and was won by England.  The first Test against New Zealand followed early the following year. These three nations remained the only Test playing teams in women's cricket until 1960, when South Africa played a number of matches against England. Limited overs cricket was first played by first-class teams in England in 1962.  Nine years later, the first international one day match was played in men's cricket, when England took on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \n\nTalks began in 1971 about holding a World Cup for women's cricket, led by Jack Hayward.  South Africa, under pressure from the world for their apartheid laws, were not invited to take part in the competition.  Both of the other two Test playing nations, Australia and New Zealand were invited. Hayward had previously organised tours of the West Indies by England women, and it was from this region that the other two competing nations were drawn; Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago. To make up the numbers, England also fielded a \"Young England\" team, and an \"International XI\" was also included. Five South Africans were invited to play for the International XI as a means of compensation for the team not being invited, but these invitations were later withdrawn.\n\nThe inaugural tournament was held at a variety of venues across England in June and July 1973,  two years before the first men's Cricket World Cup was played.  The competition was played as a round-robin tournament, and the last scheduled match was England against Australia. Australia went into the game leading the table by a solitary point: they had won four matches and had one abandoned. England had also won four matches, but they had lost to New Zealand.  As a result, the match also served as a de facto final for the competition. England won the match, held at Edgbaston, Birmingham by 92 runs to win the tournament. \n\nResults\n\nBy year\n\nBy team\n\n;Legend\n* – Champions\n* – Runners-up\n* – Third place\n* – Losing semi-finalist (no third-place playoff)\n*QF – Losing quarter-finalist (no further playoffs)\n*1R – First round\n* — Hosts\n\nRecords\nQuestion:\nWho won the Women's Cricket World Cup played at Sydney, Australia, in 2009?\nAnswer:\nEnglnad\nPassage:\nMen's Fastest Mile Times (World Records) - About.com Sports\nWorld Records for Men's Fastest Mile Times\nBy Mike Rosenbaum\nUpdated September 23, 2016.\nIt’s never been an Olympic or World Championship event, yet the mile remains the only non-metric race distance in which the IAAF recognizes a world record. Long after the other non-metric distances have vanished from the world record books, those 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards – or about 1.61 kilometers – continue to capture the imaginations of runners and fans alike as a premier middle distance event.\nThe first IAAF-recognized world record in the mile was run by John Paul Jones of the U.S. No, the record doesn’t go back to the American Revolution. This John Paul Jones performed his feat on May 31, 1913, in Allston, Mass., where he completed the mile in 4:14.4. France’s Jules Ladoumegue later brought the mark under 4:10, running 4:09.2 on Oct. 4, 1931, in Paris. The mark crept down toward the 4-minute mark throughout the 1940s. In a 3-year period from July 1942 through July 1945 a pair of Swedes, Gunder Hagg, and Arne Andersson, exchanged the record six times.\ncontinue reading below our video\nUnderstanding Baseball\nHagg ended the give-and-take with a time of 4:01.4 on July 17, 1945. His mark stood for almost nine years, during which time the pundits debated on whether a 4-minute mile was humanly possible, as a runner after runner tried and failed to crack a key psychological – and, as some believed, physical – barrier.\nThe 4-Minute Mile:\nOn May 6, 1954, great Britain’s Roger Bannister answered the questions by running the first sub-4:00 miles, finishing in 3:59.4 while assisted by a pair of pacemakers. Bannister, then a medical student, developed his own training methods – featuring relatively short, intense workouts – that carried him through on a windy day. Bannister ran lap times of 57.5, 60.7, 62.3 and 58.9 seconds. He was timed in 3:43.0 through 1500 meters.\nWhile Bannister is famous for shattering the 4-minute barrier, many forget that he held the title for less than seven weeks before Australia’s John Landy finished in 3:58.0 on June 21, 1954. Bannister retired from racing before the end of the year, to devote himself to medicine, but not before racing against Landy in “The Mile of the Century” in Vancouver that August. Landy shot in front by the end of the first lap, hoping to wear out the normally fast-finishing Bannister. But Bannister ran his own race, paced himself, then shot into the lead with less than 90 yards remaining to win in 3:58.8 to Landy’s 3:59.6, the first time two runners topped four minutes in the same race.\nIn 1958 Australia’s Herb Elliott ran 3:54.5 to break the record set the previous year by Derek Ibbotson by 2.7 seconds, the biggest drop in the world record time during the IAAF era.\nThe record returned to U.S. soil in 1966 when the precocious Jim Ryun posted a 3:51.3 time, which he lowered to 3:51.1 the following year. Ryun was the first high school runner to break four minutes, with a time of 3:59 in 1964. At age 18 he owned the U.S. mile record of 3:55.3. At 19 he owned the world record. He was the fourth and, as of 2012, the last American to reign as the mile’s world record-holder.\nJohn Walker Cracks 3:50:\nNew Zealand’s John Walker took the record below 3:50 in August 1975 with a time of 3:49.4, fulfilling his promise to the organizers of the meet held in Goteborg, Sweden. Walker convinced meet officials to change the scheduled 1500-meter race to the mile, telling them he’d take a shot at the world record. He was paced through the first half mile, with lap times of 55.8 and 59.3, then sped up on the final two laps, running the third quarter in 57.9 and the fourth in 56.4 seconds. Walker eventually became the first man to run 100 sub-4:00 miles.\nGreat Britain then enjoyed a stretch of 14 years in which three different British runners owned the mark. Just as Hagg and Andersson played give-and-go with the record in the ‘40s, so too did Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett in 1979-81. In a 25-month stretch, beginning in July 1979 when Coe edged Walker’s mark by four-tenths of a second, Coe owned the record three times and Ovett twice. Coe began the British siege in only the third-mile race of his life, in an Oslo meet in which Walker participated. Coe finally prevailed in his duel with Ovett, as Coe’s time of 3:47.33 set in August of 1981 lived for almost four years before Steve Cram lowered it to 3:46.32 in 1985.\nEl Guerrouj Takes Charge:\nOnly one African runner – Filbert Bayi, who broke Ryun’s record and held the mile mark for just three months – had owned the mile record before Algeria’s Noureddine Morceli topped Cram’s mark by running 3:44.39 on Sept. 5, 1993. The 1.93-second drop in the record was the largest margin since Ryun set his first record in 1966. Morocco’s Hicham El Guerrouj then lowered the mark to 3:43.13 on July 7, 1999 – almost identical to Bannister’s 1500-meter time in 1954 – yet came close to losing the race, held in Rome’s Olympic Stadium. Noah Ngeny ran with El Guerrouj all the way and edged Morceli’s record as well, finishing in 3:43.40. With his mark still intact in 2015, El Guerrouj has held the IAAF mile record longer than anyone else, while Ngeny’s time remained No. 2 on the all-time list. As of 2015, El Guerrouj had seven of the top 10 mile times in history; Alan Webb owns the fastest mile of the 21st century by someone other than El Guerrouj, posting a time of 3:46.91 in 2007.\nRead more about:\nQuestion:\nWho was the first man to break three and a half minutes for the 1500 metres\nAnswer:\nStephen Cram\nPassage:\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer ...\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\nCash from TV deals drives record European soccer transfer spree\n* Premier League leads way as soccer clubs splash TV cash\n* Real Madrid and Barcelona defy Spain's economic downturn\n* Clubs seen complying with UEFA rules despite investment\nBy Keith Weir\nLONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European soccer clubs have reinvested cash from television deals to go on a record-breaking summer spending spree led by teams from the English Premier League and Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.\nClubs in the English top flight had spent 630 million pounds ($980.5 million) by the player transfer deadline on Monday night. Teams in the big European leagues must now wait until January before they can hire new players.\nThe spending by English clubs broke the 2008 record of 500 million pounds, according to figures compiled by business services group Deloitte, and underlined the Premier League's status as the world's richest national competition.\n\"As the financial rewards for participation and success in the Premier League increase, so it follows that clubs are investing on the pitch to ensure they continue to benefit from the remarkable Premier League growth story,\" Deloitte's Dan Jones said.\nChampions Manchester United and the other 19 Premier League teams are expected to share revenues of about 1.6 billion pounds this season thanks to enhanced television deals with BSkyB and BT in Britain, and broadcasters around the globe that began last month.\nIt was not all one-way traffic as the Premier League lost one of its biggest names when Real Madrid bought Welshman Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for a world record 100 million euros ($132 million).\nNot to be outdone, Real's perennial rivals Barcelona spent $75 million to buy Brazil forward Neymar from Brazilian top division club Santos.\nPLAYING FAIR?\nSpending such sums might appear to defy logic given Spain's economic problems but Real and Barcelona enjoy the luxury of doing their own TV deals rather than pooling revenues as happens in England and other major leagues.\nThat has made the two clubs the world's richest in terms of revenues and allowed them to remain buyers when many of their Spanish rivals are forced to sell their best players.\nReal and Barcelona have TV deals with Spanish production and distribution company Mediapro. They both also have lucrative new main sponsorship deals this season - Barcelona with Qatar Airways and Real with the Emirates airline names on their kit.\nOverall spending levels may also raise eyebrows when loss-making clubs are supposed to be complying with new Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, European soccer's governing body, to put soccer on a more stable footing.\n\"A lot of English clubs have gone on a spending spree but they haven't breached the Financial Fair Play rules as they are only spending what they have earned,\" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports business at England's Coventry University.\nClubs also have the advantage of spreading the cost of a player's transfer over the duration of his contract in their accounts, lessening the impact on the bottom line.\nMany clubs also offload players to help fund spending.\nReal Madrid are a case in point - recouping half of what they paid for Bale by selling German international Mesut Ozil to Premier League Arsenal.\nIndeed, the total invested by Premier League clubs comes down to 400 million pounds when proceeds from sales such as that of Bale are factored in.\nSpanish clubs actually generated a surplus of 95 million pounds from player trading this summer, according to Deloitte, while clubs from Italy's cash-strapped Serie A also posted a small profit.\nReblog\nQuestion:\nAccording to a survey carried out by Deloittes early in 2009, which was the world's richest soccer club at that time?\nAnswer:\nReal madrid cf\nPassage:\nRoyal Parks of London\nThe Royal Parks of London are lands originally owned by the monarchy of the United Kingdom for the recreation (mostly hunting) of the royal family. They are part of the hereditary possessions of The Crown.\n\nParks\n\nWith increasing urbanisation of London, some of these were preserved as freely accessible open space and became public parks with the introduction of the Crown Lands Act 1851. There are today eight parks formally described by this name and they cover almost  2000 ha of land in Greater London.\n\n* Bushy Park, 445 ha  \n* Green Park, 19 ha  \n* Greenwich Park, 74 ha  \n* Hyde Park, 142 ha  \n* Kensington Gardens, 111 ha  \n* Regent's Park, 166 ha  \n* Richmond Park, 955 hectares   (2360 acre)\n* St. James's Park, 23 ha  \n\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which are adjacent), Green Park, Regent's Park and St James's Park are the largest green spaces in central London. Bushy Park, Greenwich Park and Richmond Park are in the suburbs. The Royal Parks agency also manages Brompton Cemetery, Grosvenor Square Gardens, Victoria Tower Gardens and the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. \n\nHampton Court Park is also a royal park within Greater London, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. \n\nLegal position\n\nThe public does not have any legal right to use the Parks, as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, although there are public rights of way across the land. The Royal Parks Agency manages the Royal Parks under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permits the public to use the Parks for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under the Parks Regulation Acts 1872–1926 which are considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within the Parks. The current regulations are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.\n\nManagement\n\nThey are managed by The Royal Parks (an executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and are policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing the parks, the Royal Parks Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for the Royal Parks is a central government grant. This contrasts with most of London's other parks, which are funded by local borough councils. The Royal Parks generate additional income from commercial activities such as catering and staging public events such as concerts.\n\nThe Royal Parks Foundation is a registered charity which raises funds to protect, support and create new opportunities within the Parks. They have a number of membership schemes such as adoption and champion programmes.\n\nMayoral control\n\nIn 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that control over the Royal Parks should be devolved to the Greater London Authority  and the government put forward proposals for that to happen later on that year.  The plan was welcomed by Royal Parks but it is yet to be implemented following the 2012 London Olympic games.\nQuestion:\nIf the eight Royal Parks in London are arranged alphabetically which comes last?\nAnswer:\nSt. James's\nPassage:\nDrawing pin\nA thumb tack (North American English) or push pin is a short nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and intended to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purpose. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively.  These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.  Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.\n\nHistory\n\nEdwin Moore invented the \"push-pin\" in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described the push-pin as a pin with a handle.  Later, in 1904, in Lychen, German clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed thumb tacks for use with drawings. \n\nDesign\n\nA thumb tack has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or  wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Thumb tack heads also come in a variety of colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.\n\nDomed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed tacks will point upward, posing a hazard.  Thumb tacks also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.\nQuestion:\nWhat do we call what the Americans call a thumb tack?\nAnswer:\nMap pin\n\n\nPassage:\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar’s “I Can’t Drive 55″\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar’s “I Can’t Drive 55″\nThe Story Behind Sammy Hagar’s “I Can’t Drive 55″\nBy John Robinson June 16, 2015 1:44 PM\n \nCourtesy of Geffen Records\nQ: Did Sammy Hagar do the song I CAN’T DRIVE 55 because he got stopped by the cops so many times?\nA: The song was based on an incident that happened to Sammy while he was driving from Albany, New York to Lake Placid. According to Sammy himself, “I was in a rent-a-car that wouldn’t go much faster than 55 miles an hour…..cop stopped me for doing 62 on a four lane road when there was no one else in sight. Then the guy gave me a ticket. And he said, ‘We give tickets around here for over-60.’ and I said, ‘I can’t drive 55.’ I grabbed a paper and a pen, and I swear the guy was writing the ticket and I was writing the lyrics. I got to Lake Placid, I had a guitar set-up there. And I wrote that song there on the spot.” When the video aired on MTV it ticked off law enforcement across the country and they demanded equal TV time to show the dangers of driving fast. There is also a rumor that Hagar’s auto insurance was WAY high…$5,000 a month.

Kennedy Sr. Ambassador to Britain\nLate in 1937, Mr. Kennedy was appointed United States Ambassador to England and moved there with his whole family, with the exception of Joe and Jack who were at Harvard.\nBecause of his father’s job, Jack became very interested in European politics and world affairs. After a summer visit to England and other countries in Europe, Jack returned to Harvard more eager to learn about history and government and to keep up with current events.\nSource: JFK Bio Added by: Rob Brent\nIn 1938, Roosevelt appointed Kennedy as the United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James (Britain). Kennedy's Irish and Catholic status did not bother the British; indeed he hugely enjoyed his leadership position in London society, which stood in stark contrast to his outsider status in Boston. His daughter Kathleen married the heir to the Duke of Devonshire, the head of one of England's grandest aristocratic families. Kennedy rejected the warnings of Winston Churchill that compromise with Nazi Germany was impossible; instead he supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement in order to stave off a second world war that would be a more horrible \"armageddon\" than the first. Throughout 1938, as the Nazi persecution of Jews intensified, Kennedy attempted to obtain an audience with Adolf Hitler. Shortly before the Nazi aerial bombing of British cities began in September 1940, Kennedy sought a personal meeting with Hitler, again without State Department approval, \"to bring about a better understanding between the United States and Germany.\"\nKennedy argued strongly against giving aid to Britain.\n\"Democracy is finished in England. It may be here,\" stated Ambassador Kennedy in the Boston Sunday Globe of November 10, 1940. In that one simple statement, Joe Kennedy ruined any future chances of becoming US president, effectively committing political suicide. While bombs fell daily on the UK, Nazi troops occupied Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, Ambassador Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that the war was not about saving democracy from National Socialism (Nazism) or Fascism. In the now-infamous, long, rambling interview with two newspaper journalists, Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe and Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kennedy opined:\n\"It's all a question of what we do with the next six months. The whole reason for aiding England is to give us time.\" ... \"As long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn't that [Britain is] fighting for democracy. That's the bunk. She's fighting for self-preservation, just as we will if it comes to us... I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it's up to me to see that the country gets it,\"\nIn British government circles during the Blitz, Ambassador Kennedy was widely disparaged as a defeatist.\nWhen the American public and Roosevelt Administration officials read his quotes on democracy being \"finished\", and his belief that the Battle of Britain wasn't about \"fighting for democracy,\" all of it being just \"bunk\", they realized that Ambassador Kennedy could not be trusted to represent the United States. In the face of national public outcry, he submitted his resignation later that month.\nThroughout the rest of the war, relations between Kennedy and the Roosevelt Administration remained tense (especially when Joe Kennedy, Jr., vocally opposed FDR's renomination). Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joe Sr. sat out the war on the sidelines. Kennedy did however stay active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt's reelection in 1944. He claimed to be eager to help the war effort, but as a result of his previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor re-invited.\nWith his own ambitions for the White House in self-inflicted ruins, he held out great hope for his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to gain the presidency. However, Joe Jr. was killed over England while undertaking a high-risk bombing mission in 1944. Kennedy then turned his attention to grooming the second son, John F. Kennedy, who won the 1960 election.\nSource: Wikipedia Added by: Rob Brent\nMore information\nQuestion:\nJohn F Kennedy's father Joe was US ambassador to which country?\nAnswer:\nBritian\nPassage:\nMark Dolan\nMark Dolan (born 17 March 1974) is an English comedian, writer, and television presenter.\n\nEarly life\n\nDolan was born in Camden, London.

His debut album earned him five Grammy Awards. He is perhaps best known for his US Top Ten hit songs, \"Sailing\", \"Ride Like the Wind\", and \"Arthur's Theme\", the latter recorded by him for the film Arthur, which starred Dudley Moore. \"Sailing\" earned three Grammys in 1981, while \"Arthur's Theme\" won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1981.\nPlace of birth: San Antonio\nNationality: United States of America\nChristopher Cross: An Evening with Christopher Cross\nArthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\n\"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\" is a song performed and written by American singer-songwriter Christopher Cross, which was the main theme for the 1981 film Arthur starring Liza Minnelli and Dudley Moore. In the US, it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot Adult Contemporary charts during October 1981, remaining at the top on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. Overseas, it also went to number one on the VG-lista chart in Norway and a top ten hit all around the world. The song became the second and last American number one hit by Christopher Cross.\nComposer\nQuestion:\nWhat is the title of the song in the 1981 film ‘Arthur’ that won the Academy Award for Best Song?\nAnswer:\nBest That You Can Do (Arthur’s Theme)\nPassage:\nFour-minute mile\nIn the sport of athletics, the four-minute mile means completing the mile run (1,760 yards, or 1,609.344 metres) in less than four minutes. It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.  The \"four-minute barrier\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds.  Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14 km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres).\n\nRecord holders\n\nBreaking the four-minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, by Englishman Roger Bannister,  with the help of fellow-runners as pacemakers.    Two months later, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., two competing runners, Australia's John Landy and Bannister, ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialised in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race) placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza.\n\nNew Zealand's John Walker, the first man to run the mile under 3:50, managed to run 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45.  Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.\n\nIn 1964, America's Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965.  Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun's high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001.  Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes.   In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart.   Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001.  On February 6, 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb's mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track  and 3:57.81 two weeks later.   Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic.  At that same meet Michael Slagowski joined the list of high school athletes under 4 minutes. \n\nAnother illustration of the progression of performance in the men's mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister's breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile.  Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012. \n\nNo woman has yet run a four-minute mile. , the women's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova, with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996. \n\nIn 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister's accomplishment.   He did it again in February 1998, falling just .3 behind his previous performance, still the only individual to accomplish the feat. \n\nPossible other claims \n\nJames Parrott\n\nSome sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford ) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.   Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were – following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison – accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.  Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that \"even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account.\" \n\nGlenn Cunningham\n\nIt is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record. \n\nPopular culture\n\nIn 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced The Four Minute Mile, a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone). It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard.\n\nIn 2004, Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled The Perfect Mile about Roger Bannister, John Landy, and Wes Santee portraying their individual attempts to break the four-minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing. A second film version (entitled Four Minutes) was made in 2005, starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister.\n\nIn June 2011 the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club and sold for £97,250. \n\nIn July 2016 the BBC released a documentary with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4 minute mile.\nQuestion:\nWho is popularly recognised as being the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes?\nAnswer:\n3 minute mile\nPassage:\nGPO Film Unit\nThe GPO Film Unit was a subdivision of the UK General Post Office. The unit was established in 1933, taking on responsibilities of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit. Headed by John Grierson,  it was set up to produce sponsored documentary films mainly related to the activities of the GPO.\n\nAmong the films it produced were Harry Watt's and Basil Wright's Night Mail (1936), featuring music by Benjamin Britten and poetry by W. H. Auden, which is the best known. Directors who worked for the unit included Humphrey Jennings, Alberto Cavalcanti, Paul Rotha, Harry Watt, Basil Wright and a young Norman McLaren. Poet and memoirist Laurie Lee also worked as a scriptwriter in the unit from 1939-1940.\n\nIn 1940 the GPO Film Unit became the Crown Film Unit, under the control of the Ministry of Information.\n\nIn Autumn 2008 the British Film Institute issued a first collection of selected films from the Unit. Titled Addressing The Nation, it comprises fifteen titles from the years 1933 to 1935, including Song of Ceylon. A second volume, We Live In Two Worlds was released in February 2009, with 22 films covering the period 1936 to 1938, and includes Night Mail. A third (and final) volume, If War Should Come, appeared in July 2009 and includes London Can Take It!\n\nFilmography\nQuestion:\nWhich composer (1913 to 1976) wrote the music used in the 1936 GPO film 'Night Mail'?\nAnswer:\nBritten, Benjamin\nPassage:\nMarmolada\nMarmolada (Ladin: Marmoleda) is a mountain in northeastern Italy  and the highest mountain of the Dolomites (a section of the Alps). It lies between the borders of Trentino and Veneto.\n\nGeography\n\nThe mountain is located about 100 kilometres north-northwest of Venice, from which it can be seen on a clear day. It consists of a ridge running west to east. Towards the south it breaks suddenly into sheer cliffs, forming a rock face several kilometres long. On the north side there is a comparatively flat glacier, the only large glacier in the Dolomites (the Marmolada Glacier, Ghiacciaio della Marmolada).\n\nThe ridge is composed of several summits, decreasing in altitude from west to east: Punta Penia (3,343 m), Punta Rocca (3,309 m), Punta Ombretta (3,230 m), Monte Serauta (3,069 m), and Pizzo Serauta (3,035 m). An aerial tramway goes to the top of Punta Rocca. During the ski season the Marmolada's main ski run is opened for skiers and snowboarders alike, making it possible to ski down into the valley.\n\nHistory\n\nPaul Grohmann made the first ascent in 1864, along the north route. The south face was climbed for the first time in 1901 by Beatrice Tomasson, Michele Bettega and Bartolo Zagonel.\n\nUntil the end of World War I the border between Austria-Hungary and Italy ran over Marmolada, so it formed part of the front line during that conflict. Austro-Hungarian soldiers were quartered in deep tunnels bored into the northern face's glacier, and Italian soldiers were quartered on the south face's rocky precipices.  As glaciers retreat, soldiers' remains and belongings are occasionally discovered.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Marmolada_Sunset.jpg|Sunset\nFile:Marmolada_Massif.JPG\nFile:Canazei.jpg|Marmolada from Canazei\nQuestion:\nMonte Marmolada is the highest peak in which mountain range?\nAnswer:\nDolomite Alps\n\n\nPassage:\nNadine Coyle - Biography - IMDb\nNadine Coyle - Biography - IMDb\nNadine Coyle\nJump to: Overview  (4) | Mini Bio  (1) | Trade Mark  (2) | Trivia  (9)\nOverview (4)\n5' 5\" (1.65 m)\nMini Bio (1)\nNadine Coyle was born on June 15, 1985 in Derry, Northern Ireland as Nadine Elizabeth Louise Coyle.\nTrade Mark (2)\nShe was the third girl to make it into Girls Aloud .\nRanked #35 in FHM 100 Sexiest Women 2005.\nMember of the all girl pop group Girls Aloud from the UK.\nSupporter of Glasgow Celtic Football Club.\nHas won two series of Pop Idol (2001), the first was in Ireland but she was disqualified when the producers found out she was under the minimum age.\nLives in the US.\nTouring the world, and releasing a single with Girls Aloud in March 2006.

The album was the band's first number one, and became their biggest seller. It has been certified 6x Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for sales of over 1.8 million copies.\n\nBackground and release\n\nThe album included five UK Top Ten singles, \"Say What You Want\" (UK #3), \"Halo\" (UK #10), \"Black Eyed Boy\" (UK #5), \"Put Your Arms Around Me\" (UK #10) and \"Insane\" (UK #4) which was released as a double A-sided single with \"Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)\" - a new version of the 1997 hit featuring additional rap vocals by the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nWhite on Blonde has been certified 6x Platinum in the UK, which indicates sales of over 1.8 million copies in that territory.  The album was also a major success in various European countries, such as France where it peaked at #2 on the French Album Charts. Worldwide, sales of White on Blonde are estimated at around 4-5 million copies. The album was produced by the band themselves, along with Mike Hedges and former Eurythmics star Dave Stewart.\n\nHonours\n\nWhite on Blonde has received many honours since its release in 1997. It was voted the 86th greatest album of all time by Q magazine readers in 1998.

Prime Minister Blair tried a final decoy to delay the ban until after the general election (he will need their votes), but with no luck. The horn has been sounded Tally-ho! The hunters are pledged to disrupt the nation, the general election and all things foreign (ie urban) until they get their way and are able to pursue small animals across the countryside and tear them to pieces for pleasure once more (more endearing are their badges enscribed ‘Bollocks to Blair’).\nBut contrary to Countryside Alliance and pro-hunting claims, according to a Mori Poll published in The Guardian on 18 December 2001, 83% of people in the UK think hunting is cruel, unnecessary or unacceptable. In a Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph in 1997, 77% of rural dwellers disapproved of fox hunting.\nThe Act will outlaw the cruel and barbaric killing of animals for pleasure. Other blood ‘sports’ which involve cruelty to animals, such as hare coursing, badger baiting, cock fighting and dog fighting, were outlawed long ago. The pro-hunters claim that their pastime is not cruel and helps to rid the countryside of predatory pests which kill farm animals like lambs and chickens. In fact foxes feed mainly on rabbits and rats – a benefit to farmers. There are estimated to be 250,000 adult foxes in the UK, producing about 400,000 cubs a year, most of which will die in their first year of life. Humans kill about 400,000 foxes a year so a ban on fox hunting, which kills about 20,000 a year at most, will have little impact on the numbers.\nFar worse than their disgusting pleasures, however, are the claims of the pro-hunting, landed elite that they are the guardians and custodians of the English landscape, who know best how to protect English heritage. The landowners have successfully harnessed a general feeling of grievance in rural areas as a result of a crisis in farming in order to defend their wealth, power and privilege. They shamelessly portray themselves as defenders of working people’s jobs, homes and futures.\nThe United Kingdom consists of 60 million acres. 41 million of these are designated ‘agricultural land’. 15 million acres are considered ‘waste’ and consist of forests, rivers, mountains and are predominantly owned by the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Defence. That leaves four million acres for ‘urban plot’. Of this total 60 million acres, 69% is owned by 0.6% of the population. That means that 158,000 families own 41 million acres and 24 million families live on four million acres. According to current figures, land is more fairly distributed in Brazil than in the Britain.\nEnglish landowners have consistently damaged the English countryside in favour of profits and subsidies. They have persistently destroyed wildlife habitats like woodland and hedgerows. Their gamekeepers trap and poison birds of prey to protect their pheasants (for profitable shoots), and their sheep are dipped in noxious chemicals which poison farmworkers, rivers and fish. Conservators and guardians they are not!\nEstimates vary as to the number of people who are employed directly in hunting. The Campaign for Rural Rights, launched by the Countryside Alliance in 1997, claims that 160,000 full and part-time jobs will be lost as a result of the ban. Research by the Produce Studies Group showed that the ban would threaten at least 16,000 jobs in hunting and associated trades and activities – 70% of them in rural areas. Independent research by Dr Neil Ward of the University of Newcastle found that fewer than 1,000 full-time jobs are directly linked to hunting.\nIf the hunting lobby were seriously concerned about the future of workers in the countryside (and they never have been before), then there are many other possible leisure activities which would involve many more people in work and participation than the rather select band who go hunting. And therein lies the rub! They don’t actually want to attract hoi polloi, the ordinary people, in any numbers to enjoy rural pursuits. They expect our sympathy for their civil liberty to chase freely over the countryside in pursuit of foxes, but don’t any of us dare to go for a walk across their land!\nBarnaby Mitchell\nQuestion:\nOscar Wilde described which ‘sport’ as ‘The unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable’?\nAnswer:\nFox-hunter\nPassage:\nHippomenes\nThe name Hippomenes may also refer to the father of Leimone.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Hippomenes (), also known as Melanion (Μελανίων or  Μειλανίων),  was a son of the Arcadian Amphidamas  or of Megareus of Onchestus  and the husband of Atalanta. He was known to have been one of the disciples of Cheiron, and to have surpassed other disciples in his eagerness to undertake hard challenges.  Inscriptions mention him as one of the Calydonian hunters. \n\nOverview \n\nThe main myth of Hippomenes' courtship of Atalanta, narrated by Pseudo-Apollodorus, Ovid,  Servius,  and Hyginus  was as follows.\n\nHippomenes fell in love with Atalanta, the virgin huntress who strongly disliked the idea of getting married. Disturbed by  men admiring her beauty as she ran through the forest, she declared that whoever wanted to marry her was to beat her in a footrace (herself being a notoriously swift runner), and that those who should try and lose would be punished by instant death.\nAnother version (followed by Hyginus) was that her father wanted her to be married, but she did not. She agreed to running races against her suitors because she thought she would never lose.\n\nAtalanta raced all her suitors and outran all but Hippomenes, who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win a fair race with Atalanta, so he prayed to Aphrodite for help (the goddess, in the meantime, disliked Atalanta's neglect of love). \n\nAphrodite gave him three golden apples – which came from her sacred apple-tree in Tamasus, Cyprus, according to Ovid,  or from the garden of the Hesperides according to Servius – and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta. After each of the first two apples, Atalanta was able to recover the lead, but when she stopped for the third, Hippomenes won the race. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.\n\nAtalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions by Cybele as punishment after having sex in one of her temples they entered to take a rest during their journey to Hippomenes' home (the Greeks believed that lions could not mate with other lions, but only with leopards). Ovid and Servius suggest that Hippomenes forgot to pay the tribute to Aphrodite he had promised for helping him, and consequently, during the two's stay at Cybele's temple, Aphrodite caused them to have sex after going mad with lust, knowing that this would offend Cybele, and this indeed resulted in Cybele (or Zeus according to Hyginus) transforming them into lions. Thereafter they drew Cybele's chariot, which Servius equates with the Earth itself.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Hippomenes (Melanion) was the father of Parthenopaeus;   yet others stated Atalanta had her son by either Ares or Meleager prior to her marriage to Hippomenes.\nQuestion:\nIn mythology who famously competed against Melanion?\nAnswer:\nAtalanta\nPassage:\nSee No Evil, Hear No Evil\nSee No Evil, Hear No Evil is a 1989 American comedy film directed by Arthur Hiller and produced by Marvin Worth for TriStar Pictures. It stars Richard Pryor as a blind man and Gene Wilder as a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves. This is the third film reuniting Wilder and Pryor who had appeared previously in Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980).\n\nPlot summary\n\nA blind man named Wally Karew (Richard Pryor) and a deaf man named Dave Lyons (Gene Wilder) meet when Wally applies for a job in Dave's New York City concession shop. \nAfter a brief period of confusion and antagonism, Wally and Dave become close friends. Dave reads lips and guides Wally when they travel, and Wally tells Dave about invisible sounds and what people say behind his back. At a local bar, Wally defeats an aggressive bully in a fistfight with assistance from Dave, who uses clock-face directions to tell Wally where his opponent is. Dave hires Wally.\n\nOne morning, as Wally waits outside for the day's newspapers, a man walks into Dave's shop. When the man is approached by a beautiful woman named Eve (Joan Severance), he quickly removes a gold coin from a suitcase and places it in a box of coins sitting on the counter.  The woman takes the suitcase and shoots the man in the stomach as Dave - whose back is turned - reads the information on a box of antacid pills.  Dave neither sees nor hears the shooting, but he notices Eve's legs as she leaves the shop.  Wally, who heard the gunshot, walks into the shop and trips over the man's dead body.  Dave then rushes to help Wally and picks up the gun, which Eve left at the scene.  When the police arrive, they find Dave and Wally standing over the body with Dave holding the gun. Before they are arrested, Dave tells Wally to collect the coins from the box.\n\nAt the police station, Dave and Wally are interrogated by Captain Braddock (Alan North), a talented but merciless detective who immediately hates them and makes them his prime suspects. When Eve and her accomplice Kirgo (Kevin Spacey) - hoping to recover the coin - arrive to bail them out by posing as attorneys, Wally recognizes Eve's perfume and Dave recognizes her legs, but Braddock ignores them when they insist that she is the killer. Wishing to avoid Eve and Kirgo when they are released, Dave and Wally escape from the police station, but the criminals soon find them. Eve takes the coin from Wally's pocket and telephones her boss Mr. Sutherland (Anthony Zerbe) for instructions, allowing Dave to learn the criminals' plans by reading her lips.  When Kirgo tries to kill Dave and Wally, they use the fistfighting method they learned in the bar to knock him unconscious. They then steal an unattended police car, and drive away with Eve, Kirgo and Braddock chasing them. Working together to guide the patrol car, Dave and Wally evade both the police and the criminals, but they accidentally launch the car onto a waterborne garbage barge.\n\nAfter hiding the police car, the two men walk to a motel and telephone Wally's sister Adele (Childs) for help. The police follow Adele and search her motel room, but she, Wally, and Dave avoid detection, and they drive away after the police have left. Having incorrectly read Eve's lips, Dave believes they need to find a woman named \"Grace George\", but Adele realizes that Eve must have been referring to a resort called \"Great Gorge\". At the resort, Wally impersonates a visiting professor while Dave steals the coin from Eve. Meanwhile, Adele distracts Kirgo by crashing her car into his. However, Kirgo and Eve kidnap Adele and take her to Sutherland's estate.\n\nAfter a tragic mishap with the car, Dave and Wally put their rescue plan into action, with the result that Adele escapes but the two men are captured. In his study, Sutherland reveals that the coin is a room-temperature superconductor, which is extremely valuable. Kirgo and Sutherland are killed during an argument over sharing the profits from the coin's theft, after which Dave and Wally escape the study and have a violent altercation with Eve and her helicopter pilot. When the police arrive, the remaining criminals are arrested, and Wally and Dave are released having been cleared of the charges. Shortly thereafter, the two men go to a local park and reprise a scene from the beginning of the film by dumping ice-cream cones on each other's head; enjoying each other's company.\n\nCast\n\n* Richard Pryor – Wallace \"Wally\" Karew\n* Gene Wilder – Dave Lyons\n* Joan Severance – Eve\n* Kevin Spacey – Kirgo\n* Alan North – Braddock\n* Anthony Zerbe – Sutherland\n* Louis Giambalvo – Gatlin\n* Kirsten Childs – Adele\n\nReception\n\nTriStar Pictures was looking to produce another film starring Wilder and Pryor, and Wilder agreed to do See No Evil, Hear No Evil only if he was allowed to re-write the script. The studio agreed and See No Evil, Hear No Evil premiered on May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Many critics praised Wilder's and Pryor's, and Kevin Spacey's performances, but they mostly agreed that the script was terrible. Roger Ebert called it \"a real dud\",  the Deseret Morning News described the film as \"stupid\", with an \"idiotic script\" that had a \"contrived story\" and too many \"juvenile gags.\"  On the other hand Vincent Canby called it \"by far the most successful co-starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder\", while also acknowledging that \"this is not elegant movie making, and not all of the gags are equally clever.\"  \n\nThe film holds 18% of positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite the negative reviews, the film was a box office success for its time, able to stay at number one for two weeks.\nQuestion:\nWho plays the deaf man in the 1989 film ‘See No Evil, Hear No Evil’?\nAnswer:\nGene Wilder\nPassage:\nLong Walk to Freedom\nLong Walk to Freedom is an autobiographical work written by South African President Nelson Mandela, and published in 1995 by Little Brown & Co. The book profiles his early life, coming of age, education and 27 years in prison. Under the apartheid government, Mandela was regarded as a terrorist and jailed on the infamous Robben Island for his role as a leader of the then-outlawed ANC. He has since achieved international recognition for his leadership as president in rebuilding the country's once segregated society.  The last chapters of the book describe his political ascension, and his belief that the struggle continues against apartheid in South Africa.\n\nMandela dedicated his book to \"my six children, Madiba and Makaziwe (my first daughter) who are now deceased, and to Makgatho, Makaziwe, Zenani and Zindzi, whose support and love I treasure; to my twenty-one grandchildren and three great-grandchildren who give me great pleasure; and to all my comrades, friends and fellow South Africans whom I serve and whose courage, determination and patriotism remain my source of inspiration.\"\n\nOverview\n\nIn the first part of the autobiography, Mandela describes his upbringing as a child and adolescent in South Africa, and being connected to the royal Thembu dynasty. His childhood name was Rolihlahla, which is loosely translated as \"pulling the branch of a tree\", or a euphemism for \"troublemaker\".\n\nMandela describes his education at a Thembu college called Clarkebury, and later at the strict Healdtown school, where students were rigorously put in routines. He mentions his education at the University of Fort Hare, and his practice of law later on. He also then writes; \"Democracy meant all men to be heard, and decision was taken together as a people. Majority rule was a foreign notion. A minority was not to be clashed by a majority.\" (p. 29)\n\nIn the second part of the book, Mandela introduces political and social aspects of apartheid in South Africa, and the influences of politicians such as Daniel François Malan who implemented the nadir of African freedoms, as he officially commenced the apartheid policies. Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1950 and describes his organisation of guerrilla tactics and underground organisations to battle against apartheid.\n\nIn 1961, Mandela was convicted for inciting people to strike and leaving the country without a passport and sentenced to five years imprisonment. However, Mandela was shortly thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment for sabotage in what was known as the \"Rivonia Trial\", by Justice Dr. Quartus de Wet, instead of a possible death sentence. (p. 159)\n\nMandela describes prison time on Robben Island and Pollsmoor Prison. His 28-year tenure in prison was marked by the cruelty of Afrikaner guards, backbreaking labour, and sleeping in minuscule cells which were nearly uninhabitable. Unlike his biographer Anthony Sampson, Mandela does not accuse the warder James Gregory of fabricating a friendship with his prisoner. Gregory's book Goodbye Bafana discussed Mandela's family life and described Gregory as a close personal friend of Mandela. According to Mandela: The Authorised Biography, Gregory's position was to censor the letters delivered to the future president, and he thereby discovered the details of Mandela's personal life, which he then made money from by means of his book Goodbye Bafana. Mandela considered suing Gregory for this breach of trust.  In Long Walk to Freedom Mandela remarks of Gregory only that \n'I had not known him terribly well, but he knew us, because he had been responsible for reviewing our incoming and outgoing mail.' \n\nLater on in his sentence, Mandela met South African president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, and was released from prison in 1990. Unlike his friend Anthony Sampson's account, Mandela's book does not discuss the alleged complicity of de Klerk in the violence of the eighties and nineties, or the role of his ex-wife Winnie Mandela in that bloodshed. Mandela became the South African president in 1994.\n\nReviews\n\nThe book won the Alan Paton Award in 1995, and has been published in numerous languages, including an Afrikaans translation by Antjie Krog.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nLong Walk to Freedom has been adapted into a film titled Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom directed by Justin Chadwick, written by William Nicholson, and produced by Anant Singh. Mandela personally awarded the film rights to the book to Singh's company some years before 2009. Singh believes that as the film is based on Mandela's own writing, it will be the \"definitive\" biopic of him.  English actor Idris Elba portrays Mandela in the film.  The film was limited released on 29 November 2013 in the United States. Full release happened on Christmas Day 2013 in the United States. \nWhen the film was shown in London for Prince William and his wife, Nelson Mandela's death was announced.\n\nGhost writer\n\nIn an obituary of Mandela, The Times reported that the later chapters had been \"ghosted by a skilful US journalist\", and that Mandela had later started work on a second set of memoirs without a ghost writer.\nQuestion:\n\"Whose autobiography was entitled \"\"A Long Walk to Freedom\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nNelson Mendella\nPassage:\nEast Lyn River\nThe East Lyn is a river which rises high in Exmoor, in the English county of Somerset. It flows through the East Lyn Valley in Devon.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Lynmouth Disaster occurred on the East Lyn river  due to rocks and fallen trees having been washed into the West Lyn river. These formed a log jam near Watersmeet, forming a landslide dam. When the pressure behind the dam increased to uncontrollable levels, the water broke out of the dam, and rushed down the East Lyn (via the convergence of the rivers) into Lynmouth, obliterating houses and ultimately resulting in 34 deaths. Boulders from the incident can still be seen today, lining the banks of the East Lyn as it travels into Lynmouth today.\n\nWatercourse\n\nThe river is formed as the Upper East Lyn at Malmsmead from two minor tributaries, the Oare Water and Badgworthy Water. It flows for several miles, past Brendon and makes confluence with Hoar Oak Water at Watersmeet, where Watersmeet House is situated.  The river then passes through a narrow gorge section, before flowing downstream for a further  until the river meets with the West Lyn River and flows into the Bristol Channel at Lynmouth. \n\nRecreation\n\nAngling\n\nAngling interests especially in the summer are targeted towards the salmon which migrate up the river to spawn. There is also trout fishing. \n\nWalking\n\nIt is popular for walkers with the Two Moors Way near to much of the river.\n\nWhitewater kayaking\n\nWhitewater kayakers frequently run this river in the winter when seeking a challenging Grade 4 paddle.\nQuestion:\nThe River Lyn is in which English county?\nAnswer:\nDevon, England\nPassage:\nVND - Vietnamese Dong rates, news, and tools - XE.com\nVND - Vietnamese Dong rates, news, and tools\nVND - Vietnamese Dong\nViet Nam, Dong\nThe Vietnamese Dong is the currency of Viet Nam.

In 1940, lyrics were added with Coates's approval by Jack Lawrence, and the resultant song \"Sleepy Lagoon\" became a popular music standard of the 1940s.[http://www.jacklawrencesongwriter.com/songs/sleepy_lagoon.html The Story Behind The Song], jacklawrencesongwriter.com, Retrieved 14 November 2010.\n\nCoates had originally been inspired to write the piece in 1930 while overlooking a beach in West Sussex. His son, Austin Coates, remembers:\n\nIt was inspired in a very curious way and not by what you might expect. It was inspired by the view on a warm, still summer evening looking across the \"lagoon\" from the east beach at Selsey towards Bognor Regis. It's a pebble beach leading steeply down, and the sea at that time is an incredibly deep blue of the Pacific. It was that impression, looking across at Bognor, which looked pink — almost like an enchanted city with the blue of the Downs behind it — that gave him the idea for the Sleepy Lagoon. He didn't write it there; he scribbled it down, as he used to, at extreme speed, and then simply took it back with him to London where he wrote and orchestrated it.\"\"Eric Coates in Sussex\", [http://www.musicweb-international.com/coates/sussex.htm Transcript of The Enchanted Garden], BBC local radio programme, devised, scripted and produced by Ian Lace. Available on MusicWeb, Retrieved 14 November 2010.\n\nThe resultant piece is a slow waltz for full orchestra lasting roughly four minutes in duration. Michael Jameson suggests that the piece is \"elegantly orchestrated\" with \"a shapely theme for violins presented in the salon-esque genre entirely characteristic of British light music in the 1920s and '30s\".  In 1942, Coates's original orchestral version was chosen (with added seagulls) to introduce the BBC Home Service radio series Desert Island Discs, which it still does to this day on BBC Radio 4. \n\n\"Sleepy Lagoon\"\n\nIn early 1940, songwriter Jack Lawrence came across the piano solo version of \"By the Sleepy Lagoon\" and wrote a song lyric, then took it to Chappell, the publisher of Coates's original melody. The head of Chappell's New York office, Max Dreyfus, was concerned that this lyric had been added without consulting its famous British classical composer. Dreyfus warned Lawrence that Coates \"may resent your tampering with his melody.\" Dreyfus also didn't think the melody belonged in the popular genre and that it was better suited to its original treatment as a light classical piece.\n\nLater that year, Lawrence attempted to contact Coates in person. Britain was in the middle of World War II, and contrary to Dreyfus' fears, Coates thought the lyrics fitted so well that he retorted he could hardly believe it had been written to a pre-existing melody:\n\nYou have set the words to my music so cleverly that one would never suspect that the music had been written first!\"\n \nThe resulting song was published as a collaboration of Lawrence and Coates. After Lawrence showed the song to bandleader Harry James, it was recorded for a major hit (again counter to Dreyfus' thoughts). The James recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 36549. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on 17 April 1942 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 1.\n\nOther hit versions were recorded by Dinah Shore, David Rose, Fred Waring, Glenn Miller and others. A recording with Tom Jenkins and his Palm Court Orchestra was made in London on 15 March 1949. It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalogue number B 9768. Peter Kreuder, piano with rhythm recorded the tune in 1949. The song made the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960, in a version by the Platters, found originally on the flipside of the 1960 top ten \"Harbor Lights\".  A Khmer language version was apparently recorded in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2012, the musical piece became the main musical theme of the water fountain spectacle Aquanura at the Dutch theme park Efteling. Aquanura is the third largest permanent fountain show in the world and the largest in Europe. As the show is performed nightly on a large lake, the creaters used \"By the Sleepy Lagoon\" as an introduction and linking melody throughout the show. The musical piece was partly rearranged and rerecorded by the Dutch Brabant Orchestra especially for the show.\nQuestion:\nBy the Sleepy Lagoon is the title tune to which famous radio programme?\nAnswer:\nDESERT ISLAND DISCS\nPassage:\nbeyond the pale - Wiktionary\nbeyond the pale - Wiktionary\nbeyond the pale\nEtymology[ edit ]\nFrom pale ‎(“jurisdiction of an authority, territory under an authority's jurisdiction”), suggesting that anything outside the authority's jurisdiction was uncivilized. The phrase was in use by the mid-17th century, and may be a reference to the general sense of boundary, but is often understood to refer specifically to the English Pale in Ireland. In the nominally English territory of Ireland, only the Pale fell genuinely under the authority of English law, hence the terms within the pale and beyond the pale. The boundary of the Ashdown Forest (a royal hunting forest) was also known as the Pale, consisting of a paled fence and a ditch inside, to allow deer to jump in, but not back out.\n-\nUsed other than as an idiom: beyond the extent or limits (of the thing named).\n1812, Edward William Grinfield, The Nature and Extent of the Christian Dispensation with Reference to the Salvability of the Heathen, page 35 ,\nAre they to be placed like devils beyond the pale of all human charities, and to be denied all kindly and benevolent offices?\n2000, Raechelle Rubinstein, Beyond the Realm of the Senses: The Balinese Ritual of Kakawin Composition, page 103 ,\n[…] but he was essentially a lone traveller in areas beyond the pale of human society.\n2012, David M.

Written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, and produced by Phil Wainman, \"Block Buster!\" was the band's sole UK No. 1 hit. Released in January 1973, it spent five weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart,  and also made #1 in the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Austria and Ireland, and #3 in Finland, Switzerland, Denmark and Norway. Outside Europe it fared less well as it peaked at #29 in Australia and at #73 on the American Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCharts\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nIts riff was considered markedly similar to fellow RCA act David Bowie's \"The Jean Genie\", released shortly before, but all parties maintain that this was pure coincidence. \n\nTV performances\n\nSome controversy rose after the band's performance of the song on the British television program Top of the Pops at December 25, 1973.

The subfamily traditionally contained the guinea pig-like forms along with the cursorially adapted (running) Kerodon.  Molecular results suggest the Caviinae as so defined would be paraphyletic and Kerodon is more closely related to maras and capybaras than to other caviines.   This led Woods and Kilpatrick (2005) to unite Kerodon and capybaras into the subfamily Hydrochoerinae within the Caviidae.

It went on to become the eighth best-selling single of 1984 in the UK, despite being banned on BBC Radio 1 because it \"was not credible\".\n\nIn a survey for dotmusic in 2000, respondents voted \"Agadoo\" as the fourth most annoying song of all time.  In a poll for Q magazine in 2003, a panel of music writers voted \"Agadoo\" as the worst song of all time, saying: \"It sounded like the school disco you were forced to attend, your middle-aged relatives forming a conga at a wedding party, a travelling DJ act based in Wolverhampton, every party cliche you ever heard.\"  The panel also described it as \"magnificently dreadful\".\n\nOrigins and recording\n\nThe song's origins date back to 1971, when Michel Delancray and Mya Symille recorded it as \"Agadou\" in French.   It had been written based on a tune that had apparently come from Morocco.  Club Med used it as their theme song from 1974.  It was covered by several artists and groups, including Patrick Zabé in 1975 and the Saragossa Band (a German group) in 1981. \n\nThe Black Lace group was made up during its heyday by the duo of performers Dene Michael and Alan Barton. One of the early versions of the song became popular in a Derby nightclub called Gossips, with the bar staff making a novelty dance; when Black Lace performed at the club in 1981, they learnt the dance and recorded their own version, which was the first version in English. This was verified on BBC Radio Derby in 2006.\n\nBlack Lace's version of the song was produced by Neil Ferguson at his Woodlands studio under the direction of John Wagstaff and arranged by Barry Whitfield.\n\nFormats and track listings\n\n;UK 1984 7\" single\n# \"Agadoo\" 3:07\n# \"Fiddling\" 2:14\n\n;UK 1984 12\" single\n# \"Agadoo\" (Extended Version) 4:49\n# \"Superman\" (X Rated Version) 3:44\n# \"Fiddling\" 2:14\n\n;UK 2007 CD single\n# \"Agadoo 206 Mix\"\n\nCharts\n\nChart performance \n\nDespite being banned on BBC Radio 1 because it \"was not credible\", the track proved to be a commercial hit. In the UK Singles Chart, \"Agadoo\" debuted at number 86 on 20 May 1984. The song didn't enter the top 40 until the end of July, then peaking at number 38. In its fourth week in the top 40, \"Agadoo\" reached number 2, with George Michael's \"Careless Whisper\" holding it off the top spot. By early November, the song was still in the top 40, but it fell out after the first week in that month. By 13 January 1985, its last appearance in the chart, \"Agadoo\" had spent 35 weeks in the top 100. It was revealed to be the eighth best-selling single of 1984 around that time. Fourteen years after its original release, the song was remixed and re-released. It re-entered the top 100 at number 64 on 16 August 1998, but only stayed in the chart for a week.\n\nThe song has found success in other countries as well, such as Ireland, New Zealand and France. In the Irish Singles Chart, the song peaked at number 5, but only spent 5 weeks in the charts overall. \"Agadoo\" spent a longer 11 weeks in the New Zealand Singles Chart, debuting at number 37 on 21 October 1984 and hitting a peak of number 9 in its sixth week. The song fell out the chart quite abruptly, falling 25 places to number 44 in its final appearance in the chart before falling out completely. In the French Singles Chart, the song peaked at number 48 in its first and only week on 17 November 1984.\n\nWeekly charts \n\nYear-end charts \n\nParodies and derivative versions\n\nBlack Lace themselves recorded an X-rated version of the song entitled \"Have a Screw\", which was written by Black Lace members Alan Barton and [http://www.reverbnation.com/colingibbblacklace Colin Gibb] and released on the B-side of the 12-inch vinyl \"Gang Bang\". \n\nThe Australian satirical TV series CNNNN ran a fake cross-promotion for Agadoo: The Musical.\n\nIn 1986, the song was parodied in \"The Chicken Song\" by the satirical television programme Spitting Image.  The track's composer Philip Pope had previously parodied the song as \"Shagadoo\" in Radio Active.\n\nThe song was also used as the basis of a chant by fans of Liverpool for defender Daniel Agger.\n\nAnarchist band Chumbawamba recorded a version of \"Agadoo\" for the Peel Sessions. The producer of the Black Lace version, Neil Ferguson, was also Chumbawamba's regular producer at the time and later a full member of the band. \n\nIt was parodied in a Vanilla Mini Wheats commercial in 2006 and by The Maynards in 2013, who recorded a bluegrass version of the song.\n\nIn November 2009, Black Lace recorded a version called \"Agadir\" to promote a new air service by easyJet from Gatwick airport to Agadir.\n\n2007 and 2009 re-releases\n\nIn August 2007, the \"Agadoo 206 Mix\" was released as the song was used in a TV ad to promote Peugeot's new 206 car.

Black Lace members [http://www.reverbnation.com/colingibbblacklace Colin Gibb] and Rob Hopcraft then used the song for a special charity 'Agadoo Day'.\nOn 20 March 2009, it was announced that the song was being released in a new version by Dene Michael from Black Lace's original lineup and new member Ian Robinson. A video for the release, titled \"Agadoo\" (Mambo 2009 remix), was directed by Bruce Jones, who played Les Battersby-Brown in television soap opera Coronation Street.

They are the first of NATO's new generation of medium- range missiles to be deployed in Western Europe.\nBritain's Defense Secretary, Michael Heseltine, told a deeply divided House of Commons that the shipment, delivered to Greenham Common air base by a United States plane, meant that an unspecified number of cruise missiles would be operational on schedule by the end of the year.\nShouting to make himself heard over howls of protest from opposition legislators, he said, ''I have to inform the House that earlier today the first cruise missiles were delivered by air.''\n'Reckless Cynicism' Charged\nNeil Kinnock, the Labor Party leader, accused the Government of ''reckless cynicism'' in permitting deployment while the Soviet Union and the United States are continuing arms negotiations in Geneva.\n''The installation of cruise weapons makes Britain a more dangerous place today than it was yesterday,'' Mr. Kinnock said. ''It increases the risk for our country without contributing to the defense of the country.''\nAntiwar groups in Britain said tonight that the deployment at Greenham Common would open a new round of protest demonstrations and actions against the missiles.\nFor her part, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher discussed the missiles' arrival in a speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London, saying, ''It is our destiny to be living at a time when there exist weapons of war of a dimension hitherto unknown.''\nArrival Reported in Soviet\nThe Soviet press reported briefly and without commentary the arrival of the missiles in Britain. Soviet leaders have said that the new American missiles scheduled for deployment across Western Europe would make a continuation of the arms negotiations with the United States in Geneva impossible. But diplomats in Moscow noted that the last statement by Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader, was ambivalent on whether bringing missiles into Europe or actually deploying them would be cause for a Soviet walkout. (Page A15.)\nThe arrival of the missiles at Greenham Common, a Royal Air Force base used by the United States about 50 miles west of London in the heart of Berkshire, came two weeks after the House of Commons, after a heated debate, voted overwhelmingly to go ahead with deployment. The delivery of mobile launchers and other components of the cruise system began immediately.\nNext week, the West German Parliament is to hold its debate on the stationing of the American missiles. The Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has a comfortable parliamentary majority that is expected to approve deployment of the systems, which are scheduled to be operational by Dec. 15.\nThe cruise missiles delivered to Britain today are among 41 weapons that are to be deployed in initial deliveries to Britain, Italy and West Germany by the first of next year. By then, both Britain and Italy are to receive 16 cruise missiles, while West Germany is to receive nine Pershing 2 ballistic missiles.   572 Missiles by 1988\nThe 41 weapons are the first of 572 cruise and Pershing missiles that are to be deployed by 1988. All of the Pershing 2's will go to West Germany; the additional cruise missiles will be deployed not only in Britain and Italy but also in Belgium and the Netherlands.\nThe arrival of the missiles came after 3 years and 11 months of efforts by the North Atlantic allies to get the Soviet Union to agree to remove the SS-20 medium-range missiles it placed on its frontiers in the late 1970's. According to figures given to Parliament today by Mr. Heseltine, the Russians have increased the number of SS-20's confronting Europe from 81 in 1979 to 252 today. The United States Air Force puts the current total at more than 260.\nWest Germany is scheduled to begin deploying the first components of 108 Pershing 2 ballistic missiles later this month and Italy is preparing sites for the first of the 112 cruise missiles it has agreed to take. Deployment of a total of 96 cruise missiles by the Netherlands and Belguium is still contingent on final approval by the governments of those countries and will not take place until a year or more after most of the missiles in Britain, Germany and Italy are operational.\nThe cruise missile is essentially a small, pilotless aircraft that carries an explosive warhead, conventional or nuclear. It is called a cruise missile because it cruises like an airplane rather than being fired into a trajectory like a ballistic missile.\nPowered by Light Engine\nIt has a navigational system and is powered by a light turbofan engine rather than by the rockets that drive ballistic missiles, and has a range of 1,500 miles. The Pershing 2, by comparison, is a ballistic missile with a range of 1,100 miles. Soviet officials have made clear that they are more concerned about the Pershings, with their great accuracy and speed, than with the slower, ground-hugging cruise.\n1\nQuestion:\nWhere in Berkshire were Britain's first Cruise missiles based\nAnswer:\nRAF Greenham Common\nPassage:\nAnton Geesink\nAntonius Johannes \"Anton\" Geesink (April 6, 1934 – August 27, 2010) was a Dutch 10th-dan judoka from Utrecht. He was a two-time World Judo Champion (1961 and 1965), Olympic Gold Medalist (1964) and won 21 European championships.\n\nJudo career\n\nGeesink first participated in the European Championships in 1951, and placed second in his category. The following year, he won his first European title. Through to 1967, twenty more European titles followed.\n\nAt the 1956 World Championships, Geesink was eliminated in the semi-finals against Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu.  At the 1961 World Championships, Geesink, then 5th dan,  became World Champion in the open class, defeating the Japanese champion Koji Sone. Japanese judokas had won all the World Championship titles contested up to that point.\n\nJudo debuted as an official sport at the 1964 Summer Olympics, which were held in the sport's home country, Japan. Although Japan dominated three of the four weight divisions (light, middle and heavy), Anton Geesink won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.  \n\nAfter winning the 1965 World Championships and a last European title in 1967, Geesink quit competitive judo.\n\nAnton Geesink was one of the few 10th Dan grade judoka (jūdan) recognized by the IJF but not by Kodokan at that rank. Promotions from 6th to 10th Dan are awarded for services to the sport of judo. In 2010 there are three living 10th dan grade judoka (jūdan) recognized by Kodokan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa. The Kodokan has not awarded the 10th Dan to anybody outside Japan.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nIn October 1973, All Japan Pro Wrestling owner Giant Baba recruited Anton Geesink to join AJPW. Baba sent him to Amarillo, TX and Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk trained him for a month. He worked for All Japan from 1973 to 1978, as a popular part-timer.\n\nGeesink's notable professional wrestling opponents included Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon, Dick Murdoch, Dory Funk Jr., Bobby Duncum, Bob Remus (Sgt. Slaughter), Don Leo Jonathan, and Jumbo Tsuruta.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee work\n\nIn 1987, he became a member of the board of the Dutch National Olympic Committee, and a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\n\nGeesink was among the IOC members suspected of accepting bribes during the scandal surrounding the election of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Geesink's name was cleared by the IOC which nevertheless issued him a warning for the appearance of a conflict of interest which could have damaged the reputation of the IOC.\n\nHonors\n\nGeesink was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government in 1997.  \n\nHis home town of Utrecht has a street named after him — which is the street he lived on for some time up until his death in August 2010.\n\nOn January 29, 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Kokushikan University, a Japanese university known for its sport education and of which four alumni are Olympic gold medalists in judo, with the following praise: \n\nヘーシンク氏は、一九六四年東京オリンピックにおいて、柔道無差別級で外国人選手として初めて金メダルを獲得し、その後、武道精神をもって国際平和に貢献するとともにオランダ・日本両国民の文化交流・友好関係の促進に努め、また柔道を教育学や生体学的角度から研究し、その普及発展のために尽力された。\n武道の精神を重視する本大学は、柔道の国際的普及における同氏の功績を讃え、国士舘大学名誉博士の学位を贈呈した。\n\nAt the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Mr. Geesink won the gold medal in the open class as the first non-Japanese. Since then, with the spirit of budō, he has contributed to the international peace and promoted the cultural exchange and friendship between the people of the Netherlands and of Japan. Furthermore, he explored judo in light of education and somatology and has been devoted to its diffusion and development. To honor his contribution to the worldwide diffusion of judo, this university, as a body which prizes the spirit of budō, awarded him an honorary doctorate of Kokushikan University.\n\nBooks published\n\n*\"Judo: based on social aspects and biomechanical principles, divided in two parts: judo as an Olympic sport, traditional judo\", Kokushikan University Publishing, 2000\nQuestion:\nAnton Geesink represented which country in Judo between 1951 and 1967, winning 21 European titles, was World Champion in 1961 in the open class, and won gold in the open weight division at the 1964 Summer Olympics?\nAnswer:\nNETHERLANDS\nPassage:\nTinikling\nTinikling is a traditional Philippine dance which originated during the Spanish colonial era.  The dance involves two people beating, tapping, and sliding bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in coordination with one or more dancers who step over and in between the poles in a dance. It is traditionally danced to rondalla music, a sort of serenade played by an ensemble of stringed instruments which originated in Spain during the Middle Ages.\n\nHistory \n\nThe name \"tinikling\" is a reference to birds locally known as tikling, which can be any of a number of rail species; the term tinikiling literally means \"tikling-like.\" \n\nThe dance originated in Leyte, an island in the Visayas in the central Philippines. It imitates the movement of the tikling birds as they walk between grass stems, run over tree branches, or dodge bamboo traps set by rice farmers. Dancers imitate the tikling bird's legendary grace and speed by skillfully maneuvering between large bamboo poles. \n\nLegend has it that tinikling originated during the Spanish rule of the Philippines, when natives worked on large plantations under the control of the King of Spain. Those who didn't work productively were punished by standing between two bamboo poles, some of which were adorned with thorns . To avoid being clapped in the ankles by the sticks, the natives would jump in and out of the sticks as they neared their feet. Thus, the movements of the dance were created  This however, is a mere legend and has no historical basis.\n\nToday tinikling is taught throughout the United States. In grades K-12 the dance is used as an aerobic exercise for physical education classes, to help expand physical movements such as hand coordination, foot speed, and also rhythm. Tinikling is commonly performed on special occasions such as the Filipino Independence Day as a celebration of Filipino culture and Filipino pride.\n \n\nThe dance \n\nThe bamboo is used as a percussive instrument as it is banged against the ground (or a piece of wood to make it easier to hold) and each other in a pattern. The bamboo has to be closed hard enough to make a sound, and the dancers must be quick enough to not get their foot (or feet) caught. As the dance continues, the banging of the bamboo becomes faster and harder, the sound of the clashing bamboo and the quickness of feet demonstrated by the dancers thrilling the crowd.\n\nFor this traditional folk dance, females wear a dress called balintawak or patadyong, and males wear an untucked embroidered shirt called the barong tagalog. The balintawak are colorful dresses with wide arched sleeves and the patadyong is a pineapple fiber blouse paired with checkered skirts. The barong Tagalog uniform is usually lightweight long sleeved shirts and worn with red trousers. Dancers wear no footwear while performing. \n\nWhen performed by dance troupes or in cultural shows, Tinikling is typically performed in the \"Rural Suite,\" which includes dances originating from Filipino Christians that have a more \"folksy\" character.  These dances originae mostly from the islands of Visayas and Luzon and imitate the simplicity and joy of the lifestyle of the Filipino villagers living in those regions.  Other filipino folk dances of this category include Sayaw sa Bangko, Maglalatik, and Pandanggo sa Ilaw.\n\nIn the United States, this dance has been altered into a four-beat rhythm to adjust to popular music. In some cases, it has been used in conjunction with traditional Filipino martial arts to demonstrate fleetness of foot and flow of movement.  As mentioned earlier, tinikling is used as aerobic exercise for physical education classes in the United States for grades K-12. Instead of using traditional bamboo poles, most schools create their poles using plastic PVC pipe or wooden dowels.  Another alternative is to tie elastic bands to the ankles of two students. The two students switch between jumping with their feet apart and their feet together to simulate the movement of the wooden poles. This way, more students are engaged in the aerobic exercise, rather than just the dancer. \n\nSimilar dances are found throughout Asia, such as the Cheraw dance from India, Múa Sạp from Vietnam, Lao Kra Top Mai from Thailand, Robam Kom Araek from Cambodia, Karen or Chin Bamboo Dance from Myanmar, Alai Sekap in Brunei, Ami Bamboo Dance from Taiwan, and Magunatip from Sabah, East Malaysia.\n\nVicente I. De Veyra compiled tinikling music in his book, Mga Ambahan.\nQuestion:\nThe Tinikling, a dance using bamboo poles, is the (or a) main national dance of which 7,000-island nation?\nAnswer:\nIslas Filipinas\nPassage:\nYummy Yummy Yummy\n\"Yummy Yummy Yummy\" is a bubblegum pop song by Arthur Resnick and Joey Levine, first recorded by Ohio Express in 1968.

He was modelled on Dickens' father, John Dickens, who like Micawber was incarcerated in debtors' prison (the King's Bench Prison) after failing to meet his creditors' demands.\n\nMicawber's long-suffering wife, Emma, stands by him despite his financial exigencies that force her to pawn all of her family's heirlooms.  She lives by the maxims, \"I will never desert Mr. Micawber!\" and \"Experientia does it!\" (from Experientia docet, \"One learns by experience.\")\n \nMicawber is hired as a clerk by the scheming Uriah Heep, who assumes wrongly that Micawber's debts arise from dishonesty.  But working for Heep allows Micawber to expose his boss as a forger and a cheat. To start anew, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia with Daniel Peggotty and Little Em'ly, where Micawber becomes manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate.\n\nIn Hablot Knight Browne's illustrations for the first edition, Micawber is shown wearing knee-breeches, a top hat, and a monocle.\n\nPopular culture\n\nMicawber is known for asserting his faith that \"something will turn up\".  His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation.  This has formed the basis for the Micawber Principle, based upon his observation:\n\n\"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery.\" - (Chapter 12)\n\n[The amounts quoted are equivalent to £20, £19 97½p and £20 2½p, in the United Kingdom's present, decimal, currency.]\n\nThe character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger.  Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial.\n\nKeith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) \"Micawber\". Richards is known to be a fan of Dickens. Of the unusual moniker attached to the instrument, Richards said, \"There's no reason for my guitar being called Micawber, apart from the fact that it's such an unlikely name. There's no one around me called Micawber, so when I scream for Micawber everyone knows what I'm talking about.\"\n\nIn addition, the character formed the basis of Micawber, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role.\n\nIn the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562 (2007), Justice Souter criticized the court below for an approach to pleading that \"would dispense with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's optimism would be enough.\" (quotations and citations omitted).\n\nEntry into general English\n\nThe character of Wilkins Micawber has given rise to the English noun \"Micawber\" and the adjectives \"Micawberish\" and \"Micawberesque\". The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a Micawber as \"one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune\".  Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte's legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as \"pure Micawberism\". \n\nQuotations\n\nBesides the Micawber Principle, Micawber is notable for a number of memorable quotations:\n* I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if -if, in short, anything turns up. - (Chapter 1)\n* Every happiness and prosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I had not occupied another man's place altogether in vain. - (Chapter 12)\n* You HEEP of infamy! - (Chapter 52)\n* I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon, combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre.  I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, \"FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY.\" Remaining always, &c, &c, Wilkins Micawber.\n* Welcome poverty!..Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!\n\nFilm and television portrayals\n\nQuotations from the 1935 film\n\n*Boy, as I have frequently had occasion to observe: \"When the stomach is empty, the spirits are low!\"\n* Remember my motto \"Nil Desperandum! -Never despair!\"\n\nQuotation from the BBC TV/Masterpiece Theatre production\n\n* (featuring Bob Hoskins as Micawber) \"I could not depart this metropolis without paying a valedictory visit to my dear friend Copperfield, in whose debt I shall forever remain (I speak metaphorically of course!)\"\n\nSources\n\n* Bloom, Harold.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7622.\n\nBackground\n\nThe nursery rhyme was first published by the Boston publishing firm Marsh, Capen & Lyon, as an original poem by Sarah Josepha Hale on May 24, 1830, and was inspired by an actual incident. \n\nAs a young girl, Mary Sawyer (later Mary Tyler) kept a pet lamb that she took to school one day at the suggestion of her brother.  A commotion naturally ensued. Mary recalled: \"Visiting school that morning was a young man by the name of John Roulstone, a nephew of the Reverend Lemuel Capen, who was then settled in Sterling. It was the custom then for students to prepare for college with ministers, and for this purpose Roulstone was studying with his uncle. The young man was very much pleased with the incident of the lamb; and the next day he rode across the fields on horseback to the little old schoolhouse and handed me a slip of paper which had written upon it the three original stanzas of the poem...\" \n\nThere are two competing theories on the origin of this poem.  One holds that Roulstone wrote the first four lines and that the final twelve lines, less childlike than the first, were composed by Sarah Josepha Hale; the other is that Hale was responsible for the entire poem. \n\nMary Sawyer's house, located in Sterling, Massachusetts, was destroyed by arson on August 12, 2007.   A statue representing Mary's Little Lamb stands in the town center.  The Redstone School, which was built in 1798, was purchased by Henry Ford and relocated to a churchyard on the property of Longfellow's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts.\n\nThe rhyme is also famous for being the first thing recorded by Thomas Edison on his newly invented phonograph in 1877. It was the first instance of recorded verse. In 1927, Edison reenacted the recording, which still survives.  The earliest recording (1878) was retrieved by 3-D imaging equipment in 2012. \n\nBlues musicians Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughan both popularized the song in their own albums: Guy composing his own bluesy version of the song for his album A Man and the Blues in 1968 and Vaughan covering Guy's version in his 1983 debut album, Texas Flood, with both also infusing the first four lines of the nursery rhyme, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\", into the song. In 1972, Paul McCartney released a version of the song. Just as he had done with the 16th-century poem Golden Slumbers which was released on The Beatles' Abbey Road LP in 1969, he added his own melody to the lyrics. The single was a top 20 hit in Britain although both the choice for and the saccharine arrangement of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" did much to erode his standing with leading rock journalists. McCartney played the song during Wings' 1972 summer tour and it was included in the Spring 1973 James Paul McCartney television special. It is commercially available on the 1993 CD issue of the Wings Wild Life LP.\n\nText\n\nIn the 1830s, Lowell Mason set the nursery rhyme to a melody adding repetition in the verses:\n\nMary had a little lamb,\nHis fleece was white as snow,\nAnd everywhere that Mary went,\nThe lamb was sure to go.\n\nHe followed her to school one day,\nWhich was against the rule,\nIt made the children laugh and play\nTo see a lamb at school.\n\nAnd so the teacher turned it out,\nBut still it lingered near,\nAnd waited patiently about,\nTill Mary did appear.\n\n\"Why does the lamb love Mary so?\"\nThe eager children cry.\n\"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,\"\nThe teacher did reply. \n\nMedia\n\nNote: This melody is the British version, which is slightly different from the American version.\nQuestion:\nAccording to the nursery rhyme, whose lamb followed her to school?\nAnswer:\nMary (album)\nPassage:\nSoleirolia\nSoleirolia soleirolii (,  syn. Helxine soleirolii) is a plant in the nettle family.  It has a number of common names, including baby's tears, angel's tears, mind-your-own-business, peace-in-the-home, pollyanna vine, polly prim, mother of thousands,  and the Corsican curse. It has also been called Irish moss; however, it is not a moss, nor should it be confused with Sagina subulata or Chondrus crispus (an alga), which are also known as \"Irish moss\". \n\nDescription\n\nIt is a delicate-looking creeping herb with juicy bright green or yellow leaves and multitudes of tiny white flowers. It grows close to the ground in mats and is sometimes used in ornamental gardens alongside ferns and other moisture-loving types of plant.\n\nThe leaves are usually slightly stalked, about 5 mm across. The minute flowers produce oval seeds. \n\nDistribution\n\nThis species is native to the northern Mediterranean region in and around Italy and nearby islands, but it has been introduced and cultivated nearly worldwide as an ornamental and garden plant. \n\nHabitat\n\nIt can be grown indoors as a houseplant and used in habitats for amphibians. It prefers shade and moderate moisture. It can even grow submersed in swampy environments.  In colder regions the plant dies back during winter, but it returns with lush growth as the temperature increases. It is capable of vegetative reproduction, so to eradicate it once it has become established in an area, the entire plant must be removed, or else it can sprout new growth. It is a common weed in many places.  Nurseries grow several varieties, including gold, yellow, and white breeds, but the mossy-green type is most popular with gardeners.\n\nThis species, the only member of the monotypic genus, Soleirolia,  was named after Joseph-François Soleirol by Esprit Requien. Soleirol, an amateur botanist, originally collected the plant in Corsica.\nQuestion:\nThe plant soleirolia soleirolii of the nettle family has a number of common names, including baby's tears, angel's tears, mind-your-own-business, peace-in-the-home, pollyanna vine, the Corsican curse, Irish moss and which other?\nAnswer:\nMother of thousands\nPassage:\n1998 Winter Olympics\nThe 1998 Winter Olympics, officially the , was a winter multi-sport event celebrated from 7 to 22 February 1998 in Nagano, Japan.\n\n72 nations and 2,176 participants contested in 7 sports and 68 events at 15 venues. The Games saw the introduction of women's ice hockey, curling and snowboarding. National Hockey League players were allowed to participate in the men's ice hockey.\n\nThe host was selected on June 15, 1991, over Salt Lake City, Östersund, Jaca and Aosta. They were the third Olympic Games and second winter Olympics to be held in Japan, after the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. Nagano is so far the southernmost city to host a Winter Olympics, next to Squaw Valley, host of the 1960 Winter Olympics. The games were succeeded by the 1998 Winter Paralympics from 5 to 14 March. These were the final Winter Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of  Juan Antonio Samaranch.\n\nHost city selection\n\nOther candidate cities for the 1998 Olympics were Aosta, Italy; Jaca, Spain; Östersund, Sweden; and Salt Lake City, United States. The host city selection was held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 15 June 1991, at the 97th IOC session. Nagano prevailed over Salt Lake City by just 4 votes. In June 1995, Salt Lake was chosen as the host of the following 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nMascots\n\nSukki, Nokki, Lekki and Tsukki, also known as the Snowlets are the 1998 Winter Olympic mascots and are four snowy owls. They represent respectively fire (Sukki), air (Nokki), earth (Lekki) and water (Tsukki) and together they represent the four major islands of Japan.\n\nHighlights\n\nBjørn Dæhlie won 3 gold medals in cross-country skiing, making him the Winter Olympic competitor with the most wins ever.

The coloring and taste of this cocktail resemble those of ice tea. Long Island Iced Tea also appears in literature in 1961. The drink is believed to be invented either by Robert “Rosebud” Butt, who claimed to have invented the drink as a part of an entry in a contest, or Chris Bendicksen, both of whom were bartenders at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island. Since then, there have been quite a lot of variations in the Long Island Iced Tea recipe, lending it a fruitier flavor.\nLong Island Iced Tea Cocktail Ingredients\nThe Long Island Iced Tea Cocktail recipe essentially includes:\n \nLots of ice\nSteps to make a Long Island Iced Tea Cocktail\nTo make a Long Island Iced Tea Cocktail, you would need to add a lot of ice cubes in the cocktail shaker.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nEast Coast of the United States\nThe East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nToponymy and composition\n\nThe place name \"East Coast\" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the \"Eastern Seaboard\" (\"seaboard\" being American English for coast), \"Atlantic Coast\", and \"Atlantic Seaboard\" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).\n\nThe fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).\n\nAlthough Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. \n\nColonial history\n\nThe original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.\n\nTwo additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). \n\nThe Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.\n\nClimate and physical geography\n\nThere are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:\n\nThe region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.\n\nAverage monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.\n\nAlthough landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.\n\nThe East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). \n\nTransportation\n\nThe primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.\nQuestion:\nAt the end of October 2012, New York and the east coast of America were battered by which hurricane?\nAnswer:\nSandy (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nMidlands Grand National\n|}\n\n \n\nThe Midlands Grand National is a Listed National Hunt race in Great Britain. It is a handicap steeplechase and is run at Uttoxeter Racecourse in March, over a distance of 4 miles, 1 furlong and 110 yards.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first race was run on 3 May 1969.  The race was initially run over 4m2f and was increased up to 4m4f in 1977. During this period it would have been, assuming accurate measurements, by 24 yards or approximately the length of a cricket pitch, the longest race in the NH calendar. In 1991 the distance was dropped to 4m, before being upped to 4m2f in 1993. It has been run at its present distance of 4m1f110yds yards since 2004. \n\nThe 1977 winner Watafella finished third in the race but was promoted to first place after the first and second, No Scotch and Evander were disqualified after it was realised they failed to meet the conditions of the race, along with three other runners. \n\nThe race was not covered on television in its early years but was shown by Channel 4 during the 1980s and up until 1998. The BBC took over coverage between 1998 and 2005 before the race returned to Channel 4, who continue to cover until this day.\n\nRecords\n\nMost successful horse:\n* no horse has won the race more than once\n\nLeading jockey (2 wins):\n* Ken White - Happy Spring (1969), Rip’s Lyric (1973)\n* Derek Morris - Midnight Madness (1987), Mister Ed (1993)\n* Brendan Powell - Another Excuse (1996), Young Kenny (1999)\n* Norman Williamson - Lucky Lane (1995), The Bunny Boiler (2002)\n\nLeading trainer (4 wins):\n\n* David Pipe - Minella Four Star (2011), Master Overseer (2012), Big Occasion (2013), Goulanes (2014)\n* Widest winning margin – Another Excuse (1996) – distance\n* Narrowest winning margin – Fighting Chance (1974), Knock Hill (1988) – head\n* Most runners – 22, in 1978, 1979 and 1981\n* Fewest runners – 6, in 2000\n\nWinners\n\n* Amateur jockeys indicated by \"Mr\".\n\n The 1983 running was cancelled due to a waterlogged track.\n The 2001 running was cancelled due to a foot-and-mouth crisis.\n The 2004 running was cancelled due to high winds.\nQuestion:\nWhich racecourse stages the Midlands Grand National?\nAnswer:\nWuttuceshǣddre\nPassage:\n25 Most Popular Video Games Ever - List25\n25 Most Popular Video Games Ever\n25 Most Popular Video Games Ever\nPosted by Josef on February 14, 2013\n57\nShare on Pinterest\nVideo games inherently make more money than any other kinds of gadgets or toys because of their accessibility to a wider audience, especially with the recent proliferation of technology and mobile devices throughout the world. And these day, whether you’re a hard core gamer or not, smart phones have nearly guaranteed that you are at least mildly guilty of wasting time swallowing ghosts or chucking birds. These are the 25 most popular video games ever.\n \nShare on Pinterest\nConsidered one of the best games ever when it became a hit on Gameboy it was released by NES in 1998 and players were blown away by the graphics and gameplay of the game compared with the other Gameboy Zelda games. Originally designed for the Nintendo 64DD, it was released instead on a 256-megabit cartridge, the largest-capacity cartridge NES ever produced and also was the first with 3D graphics.\n24\nShare on Pinterest\nOver 20 million copies of these role-playing games were sold by Nintendo for Gameboy. Developed by Game Freak, the first installments were Red and Green, which were released in Japan in 1996. Blue was later released in the year as a special edition, with Pokemon Yellow subsequently released three years later. Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green were remade afterwards for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 where upwards of 10 million copies were sold.\n23\nShare on Pinterest\nPublished by Nintendo for its Nintendo 64 and released in June 23, 1996 Super Mario 64 sold over 11 million copies worldwide. The third-person, free roaming, 3D platform was the brainchild of Shigeru Miyamoto who had spent years trying to build a fully-3D platform for the SNES before he quit the idea altogether. However, when the company shifted to the development of N64, he played a big role in helping the company veer away from same thumb-destroying crosspads the company had been employing for over a decade.\n22\nShare on Pinterest\nOften considered the most successful video game series of all time, The Sims has sold more than 150 million copies worldwide as of May 2011. A strategic life simulation video game, it is also hailed as the best-selling PC franchise in history. The sandbox game was developed by Maxis, and was later turned over to The Sims Studio published by Electronic Arts. The gameplay involves creating virtual characters called ‘Sims’ who are placed in homes where players can direct their moods and satisfy their desires.\n21\nShare on Pinterest\nReleased in June 6, 1984, this tile-matching puzzle video game was created by Alexey Pajitnov, a young researcher at Moscow’s Academy of Science. The inspiration for this game came from a board game called Pentomino where 12 different shapes made out of five squares are twisted and turned until they all fit together in a box. Nowadays, an estimated billion people have played Tetris, the first entertainment software from the USSR that was exported to the US. This game is available on nearly all platforms helping it earn the topmost ranking on the  ‘100 Greatest Games of All Time’ list from the Electronic Gaming Monthly’s 100th issue.\nGet more stuff like this in your inbox\nJoin over a million subscribers in our community, and never miss another List25 article.\nQuestion:\nWhat well-known video game was created in Moscow in 1984?\nAnswer:\nТе́трис\nPassage:\nTerence Cuneo\nTerence Tenison Cuneo CVO, OBE, RGI, FGRA (1 November 1907 – 3 January 1996) was an English painter famous for his scenes of railways, horses and military action. He was also the official artist for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\n\nLife and work\n\nCuneo was born in London, the son of Cyrus Cincinato Cuneo and Nell Marion Tenison, artists who met while studying with Whistler in Paris. Cyrus Cuneo's elder brother Rinaldo Cuneo was also an acclaimed painter in San Francisco, as was his youngest brother Egisto Cuneo. Terence Cuneo studied at Sutton Valence School, Chelsea Polytechnic and the Slade School of Art, before working as an illustrator for magazines, books and periodicals. In 1936 he started working in oils, continuing with his illustration work. During World War II he served as a sapper but also worked for the War Artists' Advisory Committee, providing illustrations of aircraft factories and wartime events. He served and became good friends with fellow artist Cyril Parfitt.\n\nAfter the war, Cuneo was commissioned to produce a series of works illustrating railways, bridges and locomotives. A significant point in his career was his appointment as official artist for the Coronation of Elizabeth II, which brought his name before the public worldwide. He received more commissions from industry, which included depicting manufacturing, mineral extraction and road building, including the M1. He was most famous for his passion for engineering subjects, particularly locomotives and the railway as a whole. But in fact Cuneo painted over a wide range, from big game in Africa to landscapes. Further success was achieved in his regimental commissions, battle scenes and incidents as well as portraits (including H.M. the Queen, and Field Marshal Montgomery).\n\nMany of these works include a small mouse (sometimes lifelike, sometimes cartoon-like), his trademark after 1956.  They can be difficult to detect, and many people enjoy scouring his paintings to find one. Even some of his portraits of the famous contain a mouse.\n\nHis work has been used in a variety of manners, from book jackets and model railway catalogues to posters and jigsaws and even Royal Mail postage stamps.  His paintings have appeared on both Great Britain and Isle of Man stamps.   His work can also be found in many museums and galleries, including Guildhall Art Gallery, Lloyd's of London and the Royal Institution.\n\nCuneo was awarded the OBE and was a CVO. A 1.5 times life size bronze memorial statue of Cuneo, by Philip Jackson, stood in the main concourse at Waterloo Station in London for many years, but has now been relocated to Brompton Barracks, Chatham. It was commissioned by the Terence Cuneo Memorial Trust (established March 2002) to create a permanent memorial to the artist, together with an annual prize at the Slade School of Art, given by the Trust. In tribute to Cuneo's trademark, the statue includes a hidden mouse peering from under a book by the artist's feet, and another carved into the statue's plinth near the ground.\n\nArtworks\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\n*Westerman, John F.

He presented a wide variety of shows from the 1960s onwards.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Newton Abbot, Devon, he grew up in the north-west of the county, attending Barnstaple Grammar School  on Park Lane in Barnstaple. His father was a carpenter.\n\nCareer\n\nHe worked for the North Devon Journal Herald from the age of 17 and various newspapers, becoming the Sports Editor of the Western Morning News in Plymouth. He joined Westward Television in 1961, though he worked for the BBC for the majority of his broadcasting career. He joined the BBC, to work on BBC2 in 1966. He was working at BBC2 even though Westward Television were not aware of this because at the time BBC2 could not be received in the South West. An article in the Daily Mail led to Westward TV learning about his BBC work and he had to resign from Westward TV.\n\nProgrammes he hosted include Sportscene, It's a Knockout (1967–1971), Jeux Sans Frontieres, Miss UK, Miss World, Quiz Ball, Rugby Special, Match of the Day, A Question of Sport (1970–1977 AND 1989), Grandstand, Superstars, Starshot, Ski Sunday (1978–1996) and the BBC's Winter and Summer Olympic Games coverage. \n\nHe provided the BBC TV commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, also hosting the preview shows of the international entries, and compèred the 1975 Miss World broadcast, the latter resulting in some embarrassment because he found it difficult to understand what many of the contestants were saying. He was the first presenter to introduce the tennis championships at Wimbledon (1967) in colour. He presented Wimbledon highlights until 1982 and also BBC's Show Jumping coverage.\n\nHe was the anchorman at the World Snooker Championships at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, from 1978 – the first year the BBC covered the championships daily – until his retirement in 2000 as well as the Grand Prix, UK Championship and the Masters. Vine's supposed friendship with Steve Davis was parodied in a Spitting Image sketch in which Davis boasted, \"I'm a mate of David Vine\".\n\nHis final work for the BBC was covering the weightlifting at the 2000 Sydney Olympics which he had done since the 1970s, after which he retired owing to a heart condition. He had contributed to programmes on the ESPN Classic channel. He had a coronary artery triple bypass operation in 2001,  and he died of a heart attack on 11 January 2009  aged 74 at his home near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married his first wife, Shirley, in 1958. They had met through amateur dramatics and had three children - Kim, Catherine and Martin; who lived together in Castleton Close, Mannamead, Plymouth; she died in 1970. He married his second wife, Mandy, in 1972 in Wokingham. They had a son. \n\nHe also had 4 grandchildren: Ben, Georgia, Oliver and Emily.\nQuestion:\nDavid Vine, David Coleman and Sue Barker have all hosted which BBC television quiz show?\nAnswer:\nA Question of sport\nPassage:\nApalachin, New York\nApalachin (; ) is a census-designated place within the Town of Owego in Tioga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,131 in the 2010 census. It is named after the Apalachin Creek. Apalachin means From where the messenger returned in Lenape.\n\nApalachin is in the southeast part of the Town of Owego and is west of Binghamton, New York. It is also part of the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory \n\nThe first settler arrived around 1786, but the community was not founded until 1836. \n\nOn November 14, 1957, the heads of the American Mafia held the Apalachin Meeting at the home of Joseph Barbara, a conference of mobsters who had gathered to iron out various issues in the underworld. The gathering was quickly broken up when a curious New York State Trooper turned up and sent some of the most powerful gangsters in the country fleeing through the surrounding countryside. Mafiosi and the FBI sometimes just refer to the meeting as Apalachin. This meeting was humorously portrayed in the ending sequence of the 1999 motion picture Analyze This, which starred Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. This meeting was also referenced in Goodfellas by narrator Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), and fully depicted in the 1972  movie The Valachi Papers.\n\nApalachin hosts the annual Apalachin Firemens Field Days for four days generally the first week in June.  This event began in the late 1950s and has grown from a small event in a field to having a permanent location with large pavilions (still called the beer and food tents by locals) and a large square of game booths that surround 15-20 carnival rides. Events include the Little Miss Apalachin contest, fireworks and a large parade. Profits from the event allow the fire department to purchase equipment for its volunteer force.\n\nRiverside Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. \n\nResidents of note\n\n* Benjamin F. Tracy, United States Secretary of the Navy (1889–93)\n* Joseph Barbara, Mafioso.\n\nGeography\n\nApalachin is located at . \n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the region has a total area of , all land. \n\nThe community is on the south side of the Susquehanna River. \n\nApalachin is adjacent to the Southern Tier Expressway (New York State Route 17).\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census  of 2000, there were 1,126 people, 442 households, and 307 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 763.1 per square mile (293.8/km²). There were 474 housing units at an average density of 321.2/sq mi (123.7/km²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.54% White, 0.98% African American, 0.27% Native American, 0.62% Asian, 0.53% from other races, and 1.07% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.53% of the population.\n\nThere were 442 households out of which 33.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.6% were married couples living together, 13.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.5% were non-families. 24.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 3.03.\n\nIn the community the population was spread out with 26.6% under the age of 18, 9.2% from 18 to 24, 31.1% from 25 to 44, 22.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 97.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.4 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the hamlet was $38,636, and the median income for a family was $42,647. Males had a median income of $21,902 versus $25,357 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $14,927. About 9.5% of families and 11.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.4% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.\nQuestion:\nIf you were at the home of Joseph Barbara in Apalachin, New York on November 14, 1957, I'd be very wary of you. Who met there?\nAnswer:\nMafia of the United States\nPassage:\nHawkeye State\nThe Hawkeye State is a nickname for the state of Iowa. \"The Hawkeye State.\"  According to the state's tourism web site, \"Two Iowa promoters from Burlington are believed to have popularized the name.\"  The nickname was given approval by territorial officials in 1838, eight years before Iowa became a state.\n\nThe men responsible for the promotion of this nickname are thought to be Judge David Rorer of Burlington and newspaper publisher James G. Edwards. The city of Burlington had been established in 1833 after the previous year's Black Hawk War. Edwards changed the name of his Burlington newspaper, The Iowa Patriot, to The Hawk-Eye and Iowa Patriot in tribute to friend Chief Black Hawk, a Sauk leader. Edwards proposed the nickname \"Hawk-eyes\" in 1838 to \"...rescue from oblivion a memento, at least, of the name of the old chief\", Black Hawk.  The University of Iowa's athletic teams are nicknamed the Hawkeyes and feature a mascot named Herky the Hawk. \n\nThe University of Iowa borrowed its athletic nickname from the state of Iowa many years ago. The name Hawkeye was originally applied to a hero in a fictional novel, The Last of the Mohicans, written by James Fenimore Cooper. Author Cooper had the Delaware Indians bestow the name on a white scout who lived and hunted with them.\n\nIn 1838, 12 years after the book was published, people in the territory of Iowa acquired the nickname, chiefly through the efforts of Judge David Rorer of Burlington and James G. Edwards of Fort Madison. Edwards, editor of the Fort Madison Patriot, moved his newspaper to Burlington in 1843 and renamed it the Burlington Hawkeye. The two men continued their campaign to popularize the name and were rewarded when territorial officials gave it their formal approval.\n\nThe Hawkeye nickname gained a tangible symbol in 1948 when a cartoon character, later to be named Herky the Hawk, was hatched. The creator was Richard Spencer III, instructor of journalism. The impish hawk was an immediate hit and he acquired a name through a statewide contest staged by the UI Athletic Department. John Franklin, a Belle Plaine alumnus, was the man who suggested Herky.

The famous Hollywood Sign is located on its southern slope. A good view of it can be had by driving north up Gower Street from Hollywood Boulevard to see the sign directly ahead, and then north along Beachwood Drive. One can also take Franklin Ave. directly to Beachwood; this is the location of the Hollywoodland suburb for which the sign was created.\n\nHistory \n\nThe original unnamed peak was one of the \"three sisters\" along with Cahuenga and Burbank peaks, the current flattened top being a result of silent movie pioneer Mack Sennett's unfulfilled plans to build an elaborate home on the property.\n  To advertise the new Beachwood Canyon real estate development, the developers, including Sennett and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler, ordered a huge wooden sign built atop what is now known as Mount Lee. The mountain is named after early Los Angeles car dealer and radio station owner Don Lee. Lee, a one-time bicycle shop owner who became a protégé of Los Angeles pioneer businessman Earle C. Anthony, purchased his Los Angeles radio station KHJ from Chandler in 1927.\n\nFour years later Lee began experimenting with television using call letter W6XAO.  Studios were on the seventh floor of a building at Seventh and Bixel near his Cadillac dealership.  Within a short time the transmitter was moved atop what is now called Mount Lee. An early reference to this name is in a June 1939 article in a magazine published by the California Chamber of Commerce: “Lee has bought a 20-acre site on a mountain top at the eastern boundary of Griffith Park, widening the transmission field of the Don Lee equipment to take in new thousands of homes in the Hollywood hills and the San Fernando Valley. The site is one and a half times higher than the top floor of the Empire State Building in New York. Mount Lee is thus the highest television location in the world. The transmitter is being rebuilt for installation on the mountain.”\n\nAccording to Wikimapia the immediate seller was not the original development company, but Sennett personally, \"who wasn't doing too well in the post-silent Hollywood era and really needed the money.\" Lee was the first of what would become three active pre-World War II Los Angeles television pioneers.  The others were Paramount Studios' W6XYZ (later called KTLA) and Lee’s mentor Earle C Anthony's W6XEA (later called KSEE, KFI-TV, KHJ-TV and now operating as KCAL).  Lee's W6XAO eventually became KTSL – standing for Thomas S. Lee, who had succeeded to his father’s position when Don Lee died in 1934.  KTSL was purchased by CBS in 1950 and became KNXT, today's KCBS-TV.\n\nLee’s television head was Harry Lubcke. Paramount had the legendary Klaus Landsburg and Anthony had the venerable KFI radio dual chief engineer team of Headly Blatterman/George Mason.  All three recognized that television signals from Mount Lee and similar points were inadequate to reach the greater Los Angeles basin.  They needed a point overlooking the entire area.  Part of Mount Lee was then sold to Howard Hughes, who intended to erect an estate for his then-current love interest, Ginger Rogers. Ultimately, the Hughes-Rogers relationship soured, and the mansion was never built.\n\nAfter utilization during the war by the U.S. Army, the property remained an idle asset for decades, and eventually became part of the Hughes estate.   Meanwhile, the three Los Angeles television pioneers were scouting out a more suitable location.  Television experimentation was slowed considerably during the war but post-war preparations continued. The new site was code named “Mt. Anthony” in KFI-AM house organs of the day.  After hostilities ended it turned out that Mt. Anthony was really Mt. Wilson – which is now the site of most Los Angeles FM and television stations due to its superior height.\n\nMount Lee continues to be the site of various non-commercial radio activities, but television transmissions ceased from that location in October, 1951.\n\nIn 2002, the Hughes estate sold 138 acre of their Mount Lee holdings to a group of Chicago investors. This opened up the possibility of development of four residential buildings adjacent to the sign. Many Angelenos, especially those in the movie industry, felt this would be sacrilege. A successful effort was mounted in 2010 to raise funds to purchase the land and add it to the adjacent Griffith Park.\n \nThe large tower atop Mount Lee today is owned and operated by the City of Los Angeles.  It is a newer structure which replaced the original W6XAO tower some years ago.    Smaller tenants on the site have included some federal government and amateur radio users.\n\nHiking \n\nMount Lee can be hiked; however, the immediate area where the Hollywood Sign is located is closed to the public since the area is a high-risk fire zone.  Many documentaries and blogs give instructions on how to legally hike up Mount Lee and get as close to the Hollywood Sign as allowed by law.\n\nThe trail leading to the Hollywood Sign can be accessed several different ways, the primary access-point being Mulholland Highway, which connects to the gated and private Mount Lee Drive.  Mount Lee Drive is open to hikers but is closed to vehicular traffic, excepting security trucks which pass by periodically throughout the day.  A secondary access point is Beachwood Canyon Drive, the terminus of which directs hikers to Sunset Ranch Stables.  Towards the rear of the ranch, a link to the hiking trail, dubbed the Hollyridge Trail, can be found. \n\nGriffith Park\n\nBecause Mount Lee's hiking trails and fire roads are part of Griffith Park, it's easy to get lost and be redirected.  Maps of the trails and the land around the hills should be studied before attempting to hike the area for the first time.\nQuestion:\nWhich famous landmark is found on Mount Lee?\nAnswer:\nHollywoodland sign\nPassage:\nManumission - Dictionary definition of Manumission ...\nManumission - Dictionary definition of Manumission | Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary\nManumission\nEncyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture\nCOPYRIGHT 2008 Gale\nManumission\nManumission, the voluntary freeing of slaves. Throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, the freeing of captives (who, from the mid-sixteenth century onward, were largely Africans or of African descent) implied that enslavement constituted a legal status that was not necessarily permanent. This transformation from slavery to freedom, requiring the relinquishing of control over \"property\" or \"human capital,\" was of considerable significance to all individuals directly involved in the change, as well as to governing officials and family relations of both masters and slaves. The actual act of freeing an individual slave was, therefore, regularly recorded, most commonly in a notarized letter of liberty (in Spanish a carta de libertad; in Portuguese a carta de alforria).\nThe historical significance of manumission rests on an evaluation of such factors as its frequency or availability within a given slave society, the motivations of masters in releasing individual slaves from their control, and the impact that manumission had on freed slaves, their descendants, and the larger slave societies in which both groups lived. Studies of such factors indicate that the significance and impact of freeing a slave or of becoming a freed slave depended on where one lived in Latin America. When one lived in a particular slave society was also quite crucial, as the quality of liberty for an ex-slave and the impact of the newly freed slave on the larger society varied according to the climate for manumission at a particular historical moment. An understanding of slave manumission in Latin America is, therefore, tied to the differing contexts in which it occurred.\nSlaves were freed primarily through the individual action of a slaveholder. (The exceptions were the cases of colonial, revolutionary, or national governments who emancipated slave soldiers fighting on their behalf.) Whether these masters freed their captives as an act of charity or in exchange for market value, or in order to relieve themselves of a financial burden, their view of the deed was fundamentally limited to one involving themselves and their human property. The impact upon the slaveholder's community was not as significant a concern as the personal gain to be derived from the act. Even when it benefited the freed slave, manumission was, at bottom, not a social act but a selfish one.\nIt was the job of government officials, not slaveholders, to concern themselves with the long- and short-term consequences of manumission: independent wage workers who could decide when and for whom to work; sick or elderly freed captives too weak to care for themselves and dying on the streets; healthy and reproductive slaves who competed, or threatened to compete, with free whites for economic standing, social status, and in some cases the numerical majority within the free population as a whole. Throughout Latin America, colonial and later national governments bemoaned what the emancipating slaveholders had wrought—a nonslave population of color struggling for security amid difficult material conditions and unwelcoming free whites.\nIn both the colonial and national periods, there were laws that formally discriminated against freed slaves and their freeborn descendants. In addition, the Catholic church barred ex-slaves from the priesthood, and some churches segregated nonwhites from whites in their services, brotherhoods, and burial grounds. Whites also petitioned their governments to bar free blacks and mulattoes from training in crafts and entrance into artisan guilds. Despite the clear and persistent evidence that manumission did not protect a freed individual from legal and illegal acts of discrimination, slaves throughout Latin America continued to seek grants of manumission from their owners, preferring a restricted state of freedom to none at all.\nThe distribution of grants of manumission among slaves in Latin America was neither random nor entirely consistent. Certain subgroups of the slave population, such as male and female children and adult women, were overrepresented among the manumitted, but several studies have shown that the proportions of these subgroups within manumitted populations differed according to regions and, within a region, could change over time. In addition, grants of manumission contained a wide variety of terms, which ranged from dismissal without further obligation to payment and/or further years of service by the slave. Grants sometimes required that a slave wait until the owner's death before his or her release, and sometimes stipulated that a period of service be rendered to the owner's heirs. The specific terms of manumission have been linked to such mutable factors as the economic conditions within a given slave society, the relationship of the slave to the manumittor, and the emergence in some places of large numbers of female slaveholders.\nTo date, every empirical study of manumission in Latin America and the Caribbean has indicated that less than 2 percent of slaves were freed annually. Nonetheless, manumissions contributed to the freed and free people of color ultimately representing a significant percentage of the total populations of many slave regimes—in some areas of Brazil as much as 40 percent. A mechanism that allowed individual masters considerable flexibility in manipulating the labor and lives of their human property, manumission could have the unintended and unwelcome impact of threatening the numerical majority of whites in the free population. Thus, the practice was cautiously tolerated, but not wholeheartedly embraced, as a method of social control within Latin American slave societies.\nQuestion:\nDone with the will of an owner, what type of emancipating act is a 'manumission'?\nAnswer:\nFreeing of slaves\nPassage:\nRedneck\nThe term redneck is a derogatory term chiefly used for a rural poor white person of the Southern United States.   Its usage  is similar in meaning to cracker (especially regarding Georgia and Florida), hillbilly (especially regarding Appalachia and the Ozarks),  and white trash (but without the last term's suggestions of immorality).   \n\nBy the 1970s, the term had become offensive slang, and its meaning had expanded to mean bigoted, loutish, and opposed to modern ways.  \n\nPatrick Huber has emphasized the theme of masculinity  in the continued expansion of the term in the 20th century, noting, \"The redneck has been stereotyped in the media and popular culture as a poor, dirty, uneducated, and racist Southern white man.\" \n\n19th and early 20th centuries\n\nPolitical term for poor farmers\n\nThe term characterized farmers having a red neck caused by sunburn from hours working in the fields. A citation from 1893 provides a definition as \"poorer inhabitants of the rural districts...men who work in the field, as a matter of course, generally have their skin stained red and burnt by the sun, and especially is this true of the back of their necks\".Frederic Gomes Cassidy & Joan Houston Hall, Dictionary of American Regional English (2002) p. 531.\n\nBy 1900, \"rednecks\" was in common use to designate the political factions inside the Democratic Party comprising poor white farmers in the South.  The same group was also often called the \"wool hat boys\" (for they opposed the rich men, who wore expensive silk hats). A newspaper notice in Mississippi in August 1891 called on rednecks to rally at the polls at the upcoming primary election: \n\nBy 1910, the political supporters of the Mississippi Democratic Party politician James K. Vardaman—chiefly poor white farmers—began to describe themselves proudly as \"rednecks,\" even to the point of wearing red neckerchiefs to political rallies and picnics. \n\nLinguist Sterling Eisiminger, based on the testimony of informants from the Southern United States, speculated that the prevalence of pellagra in the region during the great depression may have contributed to the rise in popularity of the term; red, inflamed skin is one of the first symptoms of that disorder to appear. \n\nCoal miners\n\nThe term \"redneck\" in the early 20th century was occasionally used in reference to American coal miner union members who wore red bandannas for solidarity.  The sense of \"a union man\" dates at least to the 1910s and was especially popular during the 1920s and 1930s in the coal-producing regions of West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.  It was also used by union strikers to describe poor white strikebreakers.\n\nLate 20th and early 21st centuries\n\nWriters Edward Abbey and Dave Foreman also use \"redneck\" as a political call to mobilize poor rural white Southerners. \"In Defense of the Redneck\" was a popular essay by Ed Abbey. One popular early Earth First! bumper sticker was \"Rednecks for Wilderness\". Murray Bookchin, an urban leftist and social ecologist, objected strongly to Earth First!'s use of the term as \"at the very least, insensitive\". \n\nBut many members of the Southern community have proudly embraced the term as a self-identifier.   Among those who dispute that the term is disparaging, Canadian Paul Brandt, a self-identified redneck, says that primarily the term indicates independence. \n\nPopular culture\n\nJohnny Russell was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1973 for his recording of \"Rednecks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer\", parlaying the \"common touch\" into financial and critical success.\n\nFurther songs referencing rednecks include \"Rednecks\" by Randy Newman, \"Redneck Woman\" by Gretchen Wilson, \"Redneck Yacht Club\" by  Craig Morgan, \"Redneck\" by Lamb of God, \"Redneck Crazy\" by Tyler Farr, and \"Your Redneck Past\" by Ben Folds Five.\n\nComedian Jeff Foxworthy's 1993 comedy album You Might Be a Redneck If... cajoled listeners to evaluate their own behavior in the context of stereotypical redneck behavior. This resulted in more mainstream usage of the term.\n\nOutside the United States\n\nHistorical Scottish Covenanter usage\n\nIn Scotland in the 1640s, the Covenanters rejected rule by bishops, often signing manifestos using their own blood. Some wore red cloth around their neck to signify their position, and were called rednecks by the Scottish ruling class to denote that they were the rebels in what came to be known as The Bishop's War that preceded the rise of Cromwell.Fischer, David Hackett. (1989) Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America. New York: Oxford University Press.redneck (1989); Oxford English Dictionary second edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Eventually, the term began to mean simply \"Presbyterian\", especially in communities along the Scottish border. Because of the large number of Scottish immigrants in the pre-revolutionary American South, some historians have suggested that this may be the origin of the term in the United States. \n\nDictionaries document the earliest American citation of the term's use for Presbyterians in 1830, as \"a name bestowed upon the Presbyterians of Fayetteville [North Carolina]\".\n\nRoman Catholics\n\nIn Northern England in the 19th and 20th centuries, Roman Catholics were also known as rednecks. \n\nSouth Africa\n\nThe exact Afrikaans equivalent, \"rooinek\", is used as a disparaging term for English people and South Africans of English descent, in reference to their supposed naïveté as later arrivals in the region in failing to protect themselves from the sun.\nQuestion:\nThe best selling comedy recording artist of all time, which comedian is best known for his \"You might be a redneck\" one liners?\nAnswer:\nFoxworthy\nPassage:\nWest Texas Intermediate\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas light sweet, is a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content. It is the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts.\n\nThe price of WTI is often referenced in news reports on oil prices, alongside the price of Brent crude from the North Sea. Other important oil markers include the Dubai Crude, Oman Crude, Urals oil and the OPEC Reference Basket.  WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent, and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nWTI is a light crude oil, with an API gravity of around 39.6 and specific gravity of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a sweet crude oil (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate price settlement point\n\nCushing, Oklahoma is a major trading hub for crude oil and has been the delivery point for crude contracts and therefore the price settlement point for West Texas Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange for over three decades.  Although the town of Cushing, Oklahoma  is a small, remote place with only 7,826 inhabitants (according to the 2010 Census)  it became a \"vital transshipment point with many intersecting pipelines, storage facilities and easy access to refiners and suppliers\". Crude oil flows \"inbound to Cushing from all directions and outbound through dozens of pipelines\".\n It is in Payne County, Oklahoma, United States.\n\nPricing\n\nWest Texas Intermediate is used as a benchmark in oil pricing. Historically, it has traded closely to Brent and the OPEC basket but currently it has been discounted against Brent crude oil. Historical price data for WTI can be found at a website by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. It is listed as WTI, Cushing, Oklahoma. \n\nPricing anomalies\n\nOn April 13, 2007 Bloomberg reported on a Lehman Brothers study stating WTI prices were not a good barometer of world oil prices.\n  On May 24, 2007, WTI was priced at $63.58 per barrel versus $71.39 per barrel for Brent (Bloomberg). The anomaly occurred perhaps because of a temporary shortage of refining capacity. In early 2007 a large stockpile of oil at the giant Cushing, Oklahoma storage and pricing facility (mainly due to a refinery shutdown) caused price to be artificially depressed at the Cushing pricing point. As stockpiles decreased, the WTI price increased to exceed the price of Brent once again. \n\nIn February 2011, WTI was trading around $85/barrel while Brent was at $103/barrel. The reason most cited for this difference was that Cushing had reached capacity, due to a surplus of oil in the interior of North America. At the same time, Brent moved up in reaction to civil unrest in Egypt and across the Middle East. Since WTI-priced stockpiles at Cushing could not easily be transported to the Gulf Coast, WTI crude was unable to be arbitraged in bringing the two prices back to parity. Oil prices at coastal areas of the US were closer to Brent than to WTI. In June 2012, the Seaway Pipeline, which had been transporting oil from the Gulf Coast to Cushing, reversed its flow direction, to transport WTI-priced crude to the Gulf Coast, where it received Brent prices. The price difference persisted, however, and was large enough that some oil producers in North Dakota put their oil on tanker cars, and shipped it by rail to the Gulf and East coasts, where it received Brent prices.  Brent continued to trade US$10–20 higher than WTI for two years, until June 2013.  By July 2013, the disparity had shrunk to about US$4. By January 2014 the spread between the two has once again increased to over US$14, but was back down to US$4 by the end of 2014.\nQuestion:\nWhat commodity value is benchmarked in the USA and elsewhere according to (among more technical terms) 'Texas Light Sweet'?\nAnswer:\nOily\nPassage:\nKola nut\nThe kola nut is the fruit of the kola tree, a genus (Cola) of trees that are native to the tropical rainforests of Africa. The caffeine-containing fruit of the tree is used as a flavoring ingredient in beverages, and is the origin of the term \"cola\".\n\nGeneral description\n\nThe kola nut is a caffeine-containing nut of evergreen trees of the genus Cola, primarily of the species Cola acuminata and Cola nitida. Cola acuminata, an evergreen tree about 20 metres in height, has long, ovoid leaves pointed at both the ends with a leathery texture. The trees have yellow flowers with purple spots, and star-shaped fruit. Inside the fruit, about a dozen round or square seeds develop in a white seed-shell. The nut’s aroma is sweet and rose-like. The first taste is bitter, but it sweetens upon chewing. The nut can be boiled to extract the cola. This tree reaches 25 meters in height and is propagated through seeds. C. nitida and C. acuminata can easily be interchanged with other Cola species.\n\nKola nuts comprise about 2% caffeine, as well as containing kolanin and theobromine. All three chemicals function as stimulants. \n\nUses\n\nThe kola nut has a bitter flavor and contains caffeine. It is chewed in many West African cultures, individually or in a group setting. It is often used ceremonially, presented to chiefs or presented to guests.\n\nKola nuts are perhaps best known to Western culture as a flavoring ingredient and one of the sources of caffeine in cola and other similarly flavored beverages, although the use of kola (or kola flavoring) in commercial cola drinks has become uncommon. \n\nHistory\n\nHuman use of the kola nut, like the coffee berry and tea leaf, appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many West African cultures, individually or in a social setting, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs.\n\nKola nuts are an important part of the traditional spiritual practice of culture and religion in West Africa, particularly Niger and Nigeria.  The 1970s hit \"Goro City\", by Manu Dibango, highlights the significance of kola nuts (called \"goro\" in the Hausa language)  to the capital of Niger, Niamey. Kola nuts are used as a religious object and sacred offering during prayers, ancestor veneration, and significant life events, such as naming ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. They are also used in a traditional divination system called Obi divination. For this use, only kola nuts divided into four lobes are suitable. They are cast upon a special wooden board and the resulting patterns are read by a trained diviner.  This ancient practice is currently enjoying increased growth within the United States and Caribbean.\n\nIn the 1800s, a pharmacist in Georgia, John Pemberton, took extracts of kola and coca and mixed them with sugar, other ingredients, and carbonated water to invent the first cola soft drink. His accountant tasted it and called it \"Coca-Cola\". Cocaine (not the other extracts from the Peruvian coca leaf) was prohibited from soft drinks in the U.S. after 1904, and Coca-Cola no longer uses either kola or coca in its original recipe.\n\nCultivation\n\nOriginally a tree of tropical rainforest, it needs a hot humid climate, but can withstand a dry season on sites with a high ground water level. It may be cultivated in drier areas where ground water is available. C. nitida is a shade bearer, but develops a better spreading crown which yields more fruits in open places. Though it is a lowland forest tree, it has been found at altitudes over 300 m on deep, rich soils under heavy and evenly distributed rainfall.\n\nRegular weeding is a must and can either be done manually or by using herbicides. Some irrigation can be provided to the plants, but it is important to remove the water through an effective drainage system, as excess water may prove to be detrimental for the growth of the plant. When not grown in adequate shade, the kola nut plant responds well to fertilizers. Usually, the plants need to be provided with windbreaks to protect them from strong gales.\n\nKola nuts can be harvested mechanically or by hand, by plucking them at the tree branch. When kept in a cool, dry place, kola nuts can be stored for a long time.\n\nPests and diseases\n\nThe nuts are subject to attack by the kola weevil Balanogastris cola. The larvae of the moth Characoma strictigrapta that also attacks cacao bore into the nuts. Traders sometimes apply an extract of the bark of Rauvolfia vomitoria or the pulverised fruits of Xylopia and Capsicum to counteract the attack on nursery plants. The cacao pests Sahlbergella spp. have been found also on C. nitida as an alternative host plant. While seeds are liable to worm attack, the wood is subject to borer attack.\n\nChemical composition\n\n* caffeine (2–3.5%)\n* theobromine (1.0–2.5%)\n* theophylline\n* phenolics\n** phlobaphens (kola red)\n** epicatechin\n** D-catechin\n** tannic acid\n* sugar\n** cellulose\n* water\n\nReferences in culture\n\nA kola nut ceremony is briefly described in Chinua Achebe's 1959 novel Things Fall Apart. The eating of kola nuts is referred to at least a further ten times in the novel showing the significance of the kola nut in pre-colonial 1890s Nigerian culture.\n\nIt also features prominently in Chris Abani's 2004 novel \"GraceLand.\"\n\nThe kola nut is also mentioned in The Color Purple by Alice Walker, although it is misspelled \"cola\".\n\nThe kola nut is mentioned in Bloc Party's song \"Where is Home?\" on the album A Weekend in the City. The lyric, setting a post-funeral scene for the murder of a black boy in London, reads,\n\"After the funeral, breaking kola nuts, we sit and reminisce about the past.\"\n\nThe kola nut is mentioned in the At the Drive-In song \"Enfilade\" on the album Relationship of Command.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat part of a kola tree is used to flavor soft drinks?\nAnswer:\nNuts\nPassage:\nRaceCourses | Horse Racing Stats\nRaceCourses | Horse Racing Stats\nby Stephen\nHorse Racing Stats\n  There are sixty racecourses in Great Britain.

Paramaribo has a population of roughly 240,000 people (2012 census), almost half of Suriname's population. The historic inner city of Paramaribo has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2002.\n\nName \n\nThe city is named for the Paramaribo tribe living at the mouth of the Suriname River; the name is from Tupi-Guarani para \"large river\" + maribo \"inhabitants\". \n\nHistory \n\nThe area, a trading post started by the Dutch, was taken by the English in 1630, and in 1650 the city became the capital of the new English colony. The area changed hands often between the English and Dutch but it was in Dutch hands again in 1667 and under Dutch rule from 1815 until the independence of Suriname in 1975.\n\nParamaribo is home to a historic Jewish community.  One of the oldest synagogues in the Americas is located in Paramaribo. It was built in 1685 near the Suriname River.\n\nIn January 1821, a fire in the city centre destroyed more than 400 houses and other buildings. A second fire in September 1832 destroyed another 46 houses on the western part of the Waterkant.\n\nIn 1943 a military plane crashed on its way to North Africa near the city, killing two FBI Agents and 33 other people who were on board. The cause of the aircraft accident was never determined and very few remains of the 35 people aboard were found. \n\nGeography \n\nThe city is located on the Suriname River, approximately 15 km inland from the Atlantic Ocean, in the Paramaribo district.\n\nFile:Kaart van Paramaribo.png|Paramaribo around 1737.\nFile:Platte grond van de stad Paramaribo (1821).jpg|Paramaribo in 1821. Indicated in brown is the area devastated by the city fire of that year.\nFile:Plan von Paramaribo.jpg|Paramaribo around 1876.\nFile:Map of Paramaribo (1920).jpg|Paramaribo around 1916-1917\n\nClimate \n\nParamaribo features a tropical rainforest climate, under the Köppen climate classification. The city has no true dry season, all 12 months of the year average more than 60 mm of precipitation, but the city does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year. September through November is the driest period of the year in Paramaribo. Common to many cities with this climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius and average low temperatures of 22 degrees Celsius. Paramaribo on average sees roughly 2200 mm of rain each year.\n\nDemographics \n\nParamaribo has a population of 240,924 people (2012 census). The city is famed for its diverse ethnic makeup, including Creoles (African or African-European descent) 27%, Indian (East Indian descent) 23%, Multiracials 18%, Maroons (descendants of escaped African slaves) 16%, Javanese (Indonesian descent) 10%, Indigenous (descendants of native population) 2%, Chinese (descendants of 19th-century contract workers) 1.5%, and smaller numbers of Europeans (primarily of Dutch and Portuguese descent), Lebanese and Jews. In the past decades a significant number of Brazilians, Guyanese and new Chinese immigrants have settled in Paramaribo.\n\nEconomy \n\nParamaribo is the business and financial centre of Suriname. Even though the capital city does not produce significant goods itself, almost all revenues from the country's main export products gold, oil, bauxite, rice, and tropical wood are channeled through its institutions. All banks, insurance corporations and other financial and commercial companies are headquartered in Paramaribo. Around 75 percent of Suriname's GDP is consumed in Paramaribo.\n\nTourism is an increasingly important sector, with most visitors coming from the Netherlands. \n\nGovernment \n\nAdministratively, Paramaribo forms its own district in Suriname.

When a reporter asked her what she planned to do with her new fortune, she replied, \"I'm going to spend, spend, spend!,\" which is exactly what she did. Her rags-to-riches-to-rags-again story takes her through five husbands, expensive sports cars, fur coats, and jewelry, a battle with alcohol, and bankruptcy as, unable to cope with her new-found wealth and fame, she rapidly spirals downward. \n\nSpend Spend Spend premiered in 1998 at the West Yorkshire Playhouse and won the Barclays Theatre Award for Best Musical of the Year.The production starred Rosie Ashe and Nigel Richards. After a week of previews, the West End production, directed by Jeremy Sams and choreographed by Craig Revel Horwood, opened on October 12, 1999 at the Piccadilly Theatre, where it ran until August 5, 2000. The original cast included Barbara Dickson, Steven Houghton, and Rachel Leskovac. The original London production was arranged by the Musical Director, Dane Preece.\n\nShortly after closing in London the production, with most of the original cast, went on a UK Tour.  The Musical Director for the tour was Steve Hill.\n\nOn July 8 2009, the Watermill Theatre presented a revival of the musical, which would follow with a 7-week tour across the country, beginning September 28 2010 to November 9 2010.

In an old and broad sense of the term, it is any nephropathy,  but in current usage the term is usually restricted to a narrower sense of nephropathy without inflammation or neoplasia,  in which sense it is distinguished from nephritis, which involves inflammation. It is also defined as any purely degenerative disease of the renal tubules. Nephrosis is characterized by a set of signs called the nephrotic syndrome. Nephrosis can be a primary disorder or can be secondary to another disorder. Nephrotic complications of another disorder can coexist with nephritic complications. In other words, nephrosis and nephritis can be pathophysiologically contradistinguished, but that does not mean that they cannot occur simultaneously.\n\nTypes of nephrosis include amyloid nephrosis and osmotic nephrosis.\n\nEpidemiology\nQuestion:\nIn humans, nephrosis is the degeneration of which organ?\nAnswer:\nHuman kidney\nPassage:\nHarry Hole\nHarry Hole is the main character in a series of crime novels written by Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. Hole is a brilliant and driven detective with unorthodox methods, a classic loose cannon in the police force.\n\nCharacter\n\nHarry Hole, a police officer with the Oslo Crime Squad, lost his mother, a descendant of the Sami people, to cancer while he was in his twenties, and he has never had a close relationship to his father, Olav Hole, a former teacher. He was born in 1965, and has a younger sister with Down syndrome. He is unmarried, but has had close relationships with a number of women throughout the series of ten novels. Otherwise, he has few close friends – and the ability to make enemies from amongst his colleagues who, nevertheless, grudgingly respect him.\n\nHole is a heavy smoker and an alcoholic although, at times, his alcoholism is under control. The effects of his problem sometimes bring him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues, but Bjarne Møller, head of Hole's department and one of his closest friends, manages to prevent him from being sacked as a result, primarily because he recognises that Harry Hole is a brilliant detective who is recognised amongst his colleagues because of his role in the solving the case of a serial killer in Australia. Hole is one of few in the force who has undergone special training in police interrogation techniques and firearms by the FBI.\n\nHole has few friends within the Oslo Police Department, exceptions being some staff at the forensics division of the Norwegian police, including Beate Lønn, whom he often uses to secure crucial information in critical situations where specialist knowledge is required, and Bjørn Holm, another skilled forensics officer. Harry is also friendly with Gunnar Hagen, his former senior officer prior to the case chronicled in Phantom.\n\nIn many ways, the author's home city of Oslo has the starring role in the Harry Hole novels. Much of the background detail of the stories involves real locations, and the city is shown \"warts and all\", ranging from Hole's favourite eating and drinking places that he frequents, to the traffic of the so-called \"Traffic Machine\" road system, the real-life headquarters of the Police Department, the swimming pool at Frogner Park, to the haunts of neo-Nazis, drug addicts and prostitutes, all of this described vividly (in the various novels) at different times of the year – in the snow and freezing weather of winter to the high temperatures of a particularly warm summer. Harry Hole's friends and acquaintances include city residents from every social background, including immigrants from other parts of the world to old school friends such as Øystein Eikeland, the taxi driver – possibly the person with whom he is closest.\n\nHarry Hole's home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett, Oslo. In Phantom he no longer lives here, as he has been in Hong Kong for three years. Near his place of residence is his favourite \"watering hole\", Restaurant Schrøder (Schrøder's, for short) in St. Hanshaugen, which figures in most of the novels. He has had a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke, whose son, Oleg, looks up to Harry as a father figure. After the case chronicled in The Snowman, their relationship is put under severe pressure.\n\n\"Hole\", Harry's family name, is the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway), with a heritage that goes back to Norway's origins in the Viking Age. The name is derived from Old Norse Hólar, the plural form of hóll, meaning \"round (and isolated) hill\". The word is pronounced as two syllables, with stress on the first (hoh-leh), as is implied in The Bat, where the Australian police call him \"Harry Holy\".\n\nAppearances in the Harry Hole series\n\n* In The Bat (1997), Hole is sent to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police in their investigation of the murder of a Norwegian citizen.\n* In Cockroaches (1998), Hole is sent to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador.\n* In The Redbreast (2000), Hole tracks an assassin planning an attack on a prominent member of the establishment.\n* In Nemesis (2002), Hole investigates a fatal bank robbery and becomes implicated in the apparent murder of an ex-girlfriend.\n* In The Devil's Star (2003), Hole investigates a series of serial killings and suspects a fellow policeman of criminal activity. \n* In The Redeemer (2005), Hole is on the trail of a Croatian hitman who kills a Salvation Army officer during a Christmas street concert.\n* In The Snowman (2007), Hole struggles to identify Norway's first serial killer.\n* In The Leopard (2009), Hole returns from self-imposed exile in Hong Kong and unofficially investigates a serial killer.\n* In Phantom (2011), Hole again returns from Hong Kong to look into a murder apparently committed by his would-be son, Oleg. His investigation draws him into Oslo's drug scene.\n* In Police (2013), Hole is needed once again to discover the identity of a serial killer who is stalking the streets of Oslo, killing police officers who previously investigated old cases.\n\nBooks\n\n*1997 – Flaggermusmannen; English title: The Bat (2012)\n*1998 – Kakerlakkene; English title: Cockroaches (2013)\n*2000 – Rødstrupe; English translation: The Redbreast (2006)\n*2002 – Sorgenfri; English translation: Nemesis (2008)\n*2003 – Marekors; English translation: The Devil's Star (2005)\n*2005 – Frelseren; English translation by Don Bartlett: The Redeemer (2009)\n*2007 – Snømannen; English translation by Don Bartlett: The Snowman (2010)\n*2009 – Panserhjerte; English translation by Don Bartlett: The Leopard (2011)\n*2011 – Gjenferd; English translation by Don Bartlett: Phantom (2012)\n*2013 - Politi; English translation: Police (2013)\nQuestion:\nWhich writer created the detective Harry Hole?\nAnswer:\nJo Nesbø\nPassage:\nRepublic of Upper Volta\nThe Republic of Upper Volta () was a landlocked west-African country established on December 11, 1958, as a self-governing colony within the French Community. Before attaining autonomy it had been French Upper Volta and  part of the French Union. On August 5, 1960, it attained full independence from France.\n\nOverview\n\nThomas Sankara came to power through a military coup d'état on August 4, 1983. After the coup, he formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Under the direction of Sankara, the country changed its name on August 4, 1984, from the Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which means \"Land of Incorruptible People\".\n\nThe name Upper Volta indicated that the country contains the upper part of the Volta River. The river is divided into three parts—the Black Volta, White Volta, and Red Volta, which form the colors of the national flag corresponding to parts of the river.\nQuestion:\nThe Republic of Upper Volta was renamed what (two-words) in 1984, meaning respectively 'men of integrity' and 'fatherland' in its two native languages?\nAnswer:\nBourkina-Fasso\nPassage:\nHome Thoughts from Abroad\nHome-Thoughts, from Abroad is a poem by Robert Browning.

It is one of the largest impact basins in the Solar System. The plain itself is about 685 km in diameter. \"Calor\" is Latin for \"heat\" and the basin is so-named because the Sun is almost directly overhead every second time Mercury passes perihelion.  The crater, discovered in 1974, is surrounded by a ring of mountains approximately 2 km tall.\n\nAppearance\n\nCaloris was discovered on images taken by the Mariner 10 probe in 1974.  It was situated on the terminator—the line dividing the daytime and nighttime hemispheres—at the time the probe passed by, and so half of the crater could not be imaged. Later, on January 15, 2008, one of the first photos of the planet taken by the MESSENGER probe revealed the crater in its entirety.\n\nThe basin was initially estimated to be about 810 mi in diameter, though this was increased to 960 mi based on subsequent images taken by MESSENGER. It is ringed by mountains up to 2 km high.  Inside the crater walls, the floor of the crater is filled by lava plains,  similar to the maria of the Moon. These plains are superposed by explosive vents associated with pyroclastic material. Outside the walls, material ejected in the impact which created the basin extends for , and concentric rings surround the crater.\n\nIn the center of the basin is a region containing numerous radial troughs that appear to be extensional faults, with a 40 km crater located near the center of the pattern. The exact cause of this pattern of troughs is not currently known. The feature is named Pantheon Fossae. \n\nFormation\n\nThe impacting body is estimated to have been at least 100 km (62 miles) in diameter.  \n\nBodies in the inner Solar System experienced a heavy bombardment of large rocky bodies in the first billion years or so of the Solar System. The impact which created Caloris must have occurred after most of the heavy bombardment had finished, because fewer impact craters are seen on its floor than exist on comparably-sized regions outside the crater.  Similar impact basins on the Moon such as the Mare Imbrium and Mare Orientale are believed to have formed at about the same time, possibly indicating that there was a 'spike' of large impacts towards the end of the heavy bombardment phase of the early Solar System.  Based on MESSENGER's photographs, Caloris' age has been determined to be between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years.\n\nAntipodal chaotic terrain and global effects\n\nThe giant impact believed to have formed Caloris may have had global consequences for the planet.  At the exact antipode of the basin is a large area of hilly, grooved terrain, with few small impact craters that are known as chaotic terrain (also \"weird terrain\"). It is thought by some to have been created as seismic waves from the impact converged on the opposite side of the planet.  Alternatively, it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin’s antipode.  This hypothetical impact is also believed to have triggered volcanic activity on Mercury, resulting in the formation of smooth plains.  Surrounding Caloris is a series of geologic formations thought to have been produced by the basin's ejecta, collectively called the Caloris Group.\n\nEmissions of gas\n\nMercury has a very tenuous and transient atmosphere, containing small amounts of hydrogen and helium captured from the solar wind, as well as heavier elements such as sodium and potassium.  These are thought to originate within the planet, being \"out-gassed\" from beneath its crust.  The Caloris basin has been found to be a significant source of sodium and potassium, indicating that the fractures created by the impact facilitate the release of gases from within the planet.  The weird terrain is also a source of these gases. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Caloris basin labeled.png|Mosaic of half of Caloris basin photographed by Mariner 10 in 1974–75.\nFile:Spider crater on planet mercury.jpg|Pantheon Fossae in Caloris\nFile:Mercury weird terrain.jpg|Hilly, lineated terrain at the antipode of Caloris \nFile:Mercury's 'Weird Terrain'.jpg|Close up of the chaotic terrain\nFile:PIA19421-Mercury-Craters-MunchSanderPoe-20150416.jpg|Enhanced color image of craters amid plains near Caloris basin\nFile:PIA19450-PlanetMercury-CalorisBasin-20150501.jpg|Perspective view of Caloris – high (red); low (blue).\nQuestion:\nThe Caloris Basin, a large impact crater, is on which planet in our solar system?\nAnswer:\nMercury\nPassage:\n2016 RIO OLYMPICS: HISTORY OF BOXING IN THE SUMMER GAMES ...\n2016 RIO OLYMPICS:  HISTORY OF BOXING IN THE SUMMER GAMES PART III\n2016 RIO OLYMPICS:  HISTORY OF BOXING IN THE SUMMER GAMES PART III\nBy Maloney L. Samaco\nPhilBoxing.com\nWed, 20 Jul 2016\nIn London in 1948 very strong southpaw fighter Laszlo Papp made his Olympic debut where he won the first of his three successive Olympic golds. The Hungarian also grabbed the light middleweight gold medals in the 1952 and 1956 Games, becoming the first athlete to win three Olympic boxing titles which was later equalled by Cubans Teofilo Stevenson and Felix Savon. Papp was the first Soviet bloc fighter to turn professional.  He once said, \"I fight for money, but I am not greedy. How many steaks can one man eat?\"\nDuring the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, 17-year-old Floyd Patterson, fighting  from Brooklyn, New York,  won four bouts en route to the finals. In the gold medal match, Patterson knocked his opponent Romanian Vasile Tita out in just 74 seconds with an  uppercut to the chin. Patterson turned pro and became the youngest heavyweight champion in the world at age 21 until Mike Tyson broke the record at age 20.\nIn the 1956 Melbourne Games, an American soldier named Pete Rademacher from Yakima, Washington, faced mighty Soviet Russian Lev Mukhin in the finals. Mukhin won all three of his bouts by knockout or TKO, and was a heavy favorite to win the gold medal. But Rademacher reversed the outcome as he knocked down Mukin in 50 seconds, then twice more in the next 80 seconds. When he turned professional Rademacher would face Floyd Patterson in his debut. He floored  Patterson in the second round, but lost the fight in Round 6.\nWinning the light heavyweight gold at the 1960 Rome Olympics, Cassius Clay began a step toward becoming the most popular and quotable athlete in the world. Clay, then age 18, gave the world a preliminary glance of his extraordinary skill in the ring and likewise his speaking finesse, when a Soviet journalist asked him about racial descrimination in America he answered: \"Russian, we got qualified men working on that problem. We got the biggest and the prettiest cars. We got all the food we can eat. America is the greatest country in the world, and as far as places I can't eat  goes, I got lots of places I can eat, more places I can than I can't.\" Four years later, Clay, this time named Muhammad Ali, won his first world heavyweight title.\nJoe Frazier at first was not included in the US boxing team to the 1964 Tokyo Games, Asia's first Olympic Games. But a broken knuckle caused Buster Mathis to withdraw, so Frazier came as a substitute. The Philadelphia native heavyweight boxer, won a decision by a slim margin over West German Hans Huber in the final match, despite fighting hurt with a broken hand. Smokin' Joe Frazier was the only boxing finalist for the United States in the 1964 Games and later became a world heavyweight champion as a professional.\nIn the 1968 Games in Mexico, George Foreman was practically a beginner in the sport of boxing with only 18 matches in his experience.  But he came out the heavyweight gold medal winner. After the Games, Foreman was on the headlines as a professional boxer in a colorful career that included a first world title in 1973, a historic bout with Muhammad Ali in the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" in 1974, and as an unbelievable world champion in 1994 at age 45.\nQuestion:\nWho was the first boxer to win three successive Olympic Heavyweight titles?\nAnswer:\nTeófilo Stevenson Lawrence\nPassage:\nWindsock\nA windsock is a conical textile tube which resembles a giant sock. Windsocks typically are used at airports to indicate the direction and strength of the wind to pilots and at chemical plants where there is risk of gaseous leakage. They are sometimes located alongside highways at windy locations.\n\nWind direction is the opposite of the direction in which the windsock is pointing (note that wind directions are conventionally specified as being the compass point from which the wind originates; so a windsock pointing due north indicates a southerly wind). Wind speed is indicated by the windsock's angle relative to the mounting pole; in low winds, the windsock droops; in high winds it flies horizontally.\n\nPer FAA standards referenced below, a 15 kn wind will fully extend the properly functioning windsock. A 3 kn breeze will cause the properly functioning windsock to orient itself according to the wind.\n\nPer Transport Canada standards: a 15 kn wind will fully extend the wind sock, a 10 kn wind will cause the wind sock to be 5° below the horizontal, a 6 kn wind will cause the wind sock to be 30° below the horizontal.\n\nAt many airports, windsocks are lighted at night, either by flood lights on top surrounding it or with one mounted on the pole shining inside it.\n\nWindsocks are also popular with children and can have bright and colorful designs. These windsocks are not particularly functional and are mostly for decoration. However, they can be used as a basic guide to wind direction and speed.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name for the conical textile tube hung from a pole at airports used to indicate wind direction and relative speed?\nAnswer:\nWindsock\nPassage:\nNight monkey\nThe night monkeys, also known as the owl monkeys or douroucoulis, are the members of the genus Aotus of New World monkeys (monotypic in family Aotidae). The only nocturnal monkeys, they are native to Panama and much of tropical South America. Night monkeys constitute one of the few monkey species that are affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan Plasmodium falciparum, making them useful as non-human primate experimental models in malaria research. \n\nTaxonomy\n\nUntil 1983, all night monkeys were placed into only one (A. lemurimus) or two species (A. lemurinus and A. azarae). Chromosome variability showed that there was more than one species in the genus and Hershkovitz (1983) used morphological and karyological evidence to propose nine species, one of which is now recognised as a junior synonym. He split Aotus into two groups: a northern, gray-necked group (A. lemurinus, A. hershkovitzi, A. trivirgatus and A. vociferans) and a southern, red-necked group (A. miconax, A. nancymaae, A. nigriceps and A. azarae). Arguably, the taxa otherwise considered subspecies of A. lemurinus – brumbacki, griseimembra and zonalis – should be considered separate species, whereas A. hershkovitzi arguably is a junior synonym of A. lemurinus. A new species from the gray-necked group was recently described as A. jorgehernandezi.  As is the case with some other splits in this genus, an essential part of the argument for recognizing this new species was differences in the chromosomes. Chromosome evidence has also been used as an argument for merging \"species\", as was the case for considering infulatus a subspecies of A. azarae rather than a separate species.  Fossil species have (correctly or incorrectly) been assigned to this genus, but only extant species are listed below.\n\nClassification\n\nFamily Aotidae\n* Aotus lemurinus (gray-necked) group:\n** Gray-bellied night monkey, Aotus lemurinus\n** Panamanian night monkey, Aotus zonalis\n** Gray-handed night monkey, Aotus griseimembra\n** Hernández-Camacho's night monkey, Aotus jorgehernandezi\n** Brumback's night monkey, Aotus brumbacki\n** Three-striped night monkey, Aotus trivirgatus\n** Spix's night monkey, Aotus vociferans\n* Aotus azarae (red-necked) group:\n** Azara's night monkey, Aotus azarae\n** Peruvian night monkey, Aotus miconax\n** Nancy Ma's night monkey, Aotus nancymaae\n** Black-headed night monkey, Aotus nigriceps\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nNight monkeys have large brown eyes; the size improves their nocturnal vision, thus increasing their ability to be active at night. Their ears are rather difficult to see; this is why their genus name, Aotus (meaning \"earless\") was chosen. There is little data on the weights of wild night monkeys. From the figures that have been collected, it appears that males and females are similar in weight; the heaviest species is Azara's night monkey at around , and the lightest is Brumback's night monkey, which weighs between . The male is slightly taller than the female, measuring , respectively.\n\nEcology\n\nNight monkeys can be found in Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela. The species that live at higher elevations tend to have thicker fur than the monkeys at sea level. The night monkey can live in forests undisturbed by humans (primary forest) as well as forests that are recovering from human logging efforts (secondary forest).Cawthon Lang KA. 2005 July 18. [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/owl_monkey/taxon Primate Factsheets: Owl monkey (Aotus) Taxonomy, Morphology, & Ecology]. Accessed 2012 July 25.\n\nBehavior\n\nThe name \"night monkey\" comes from the fact that all species are active at night and are, in fact, the only truly nocturnal monkeys (an exception is the subspecies Aotus azarae azarae, which is cathemeral). Night monkeys make a notably wide variety of vocal sounds, with up to eight categories of distinct calls (gruff grunts, resonant grunts, sneeze grunts, screams, low trills, moans, gulps, and hoots), and a frequency range of 190-1,950 Hz.  Unusual among the New World monkeys, they are monochromats, that is, they have no colour vision, presumably because it is of no advantage given their nocturnal habits. They have a better spatial resolution at low light levels than other primates, which contributes to their ability to capture insects and move at night.  Night monkeys live in family groups consisting of a mated pair and their immature offspring. Family groups defend territories by vocal calls and scent marking.\n\nThe night monkey is socially monogamous, and all night monkeys form pair bonds. Only one infant is born each year. The male is the primary caregiver, and the mother only carries the infant for the first week or so of its life. This is believed to have developed because it increases the survival of the infant and reduces the metabolic costs on the female. Adults will occasionally be evicted from the group by same-sex individuals, either kin or outsiders.\nQuestion:\nA douroucouli is what type of animal?\nAnswer:\nMonkey\n\n\nPassage:\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot - Wiktionary\nfagot\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea, \\ Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?\nAlternative form of faggot (shrivelled old woman)\nAlternative form of faggot (a gay person, particularly a man)\nA bundle of pieces of wrought iron to be worked over into bars or other shapes by rolling or hammering at a welding heat; a pile .\n(music, obsolete ) A fagotto , or bassoon .\n( Britain , obsolete ) A person hired to take the place of another at the muster of a company .\n(Can we find and add a quotation of Addison to this entry?)\nQuestion:\nWhich musical instrument has an Italian name fagotto which means a 'bundle of sticks'?\nAnswer:\n",

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nAnything You Can Do (song)\n\"Anything You Can Do\" is a song composed by Irving Berlin for the 1946 Broadway musical, Annie Get Your Gun.   The song is a duet, with one male singer and one female singer attempting to outdo each other in increasingly complex tasks. \n\nIn the musical, the song sets the scene for the climactic sharpshooting contest between Annie Oakley and Frank Butler.  Its most memorable lines are, \"Anything you can do I can do better; I can do anything better than you.\" The song was first performed in Annie Get Your Gun by Ethel Merman and Ray Middleton. \n\nDuring the song, they argue playfully about who can, for example, sing softer, sing higher, sing sweeter, and hold a note for longer, and boast of their abilities and accomplishments, such as opening safes and living on bread and cheese, although Annie always seems to counter Frank's argument. Neither can \"bake a pie,\" though. \n\nNotable versions\n\n* Ethel Merman and Howard Keel (1950)\n* Betty Hutton and Howard Keel in the 1950 film version of the musical\n* Doris Day and Robert Goulet (1963)\n* Mary Martin and John Raitt on the National Tour recording\n* Ethel Merman and Bruce Yarnell in the 1966 revival recording.\n* Dusty Springfield and Freddie Paris on Bandstand (1967).\n* Robert Morse and an office computer in 1968 TV series That's Life, episode S1E11 \"Bobby's Pink Slip\" \n* Ethel Merman and Miss Piggy (1976) in The Muppet Show, episode 1.22\n* In 1977, Tina Arena and John Bowles recorded a version for their album Tiny Tina and Little John. \n* In 1990, Kidsongs released Ride the Roller Coaster, which contained a version of this song.\n* Fran Drescher and Madeline Zima (1994) in The Nanny, episode S1E22 \"I Don't Remember Mama\"\n* Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm, Gatorade \"Michael vs. Mia\" commercial (1997), performed by Sophia Ramos\n* Bernadette Peters and Tom Wopat in the 1999 Broadway revival version of the musical\n* Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso in a 2007 Mercedes-Benz commercial with Mika Häkkinen performing the last line.\n* American rapper J.

It is a story that presents the tragic consequences of a sea captain's pride.  On an ill-fated voyage in winter, he brings his daughter aboard ship for company. The captain ignores the advice of one of his experienced men, who fears that a hurricane is approaching. When the storm\narrives, the captain ties his daughter to the mast to prevent her from being swept overboard. She calls out to her dying father as she hears the surf beating on the shore, then prays to Christ to calm the seas. The ship crashes onto the reef of Norman's Woe and sinks; the next morning a horrified fisherman finds the daughter's body, still tied to the mast and drifting in the surf. The poem ends with a prayer that all be spared such a fate \"on the reef of Norman's Woe.\"\n\nThe poem was published in the New World, edited by Park Benjamin, which appeared on January 10, 1840. Longfellow was paid $25 for it.\n\nInspiration\n\nLongfellow combined fact and fiction to create this poem. His inspiration was the great Blizzard of 1839, which ravaged the northeast coast of the United States for 12 hours starting January 6, 1839, destroying 20 ships with a loss of 40 lives.  He probably drew specifically on the destruction of the Favorite, a ship from Wiscasset, Maine, on the reef of Norman's Woe off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts. All hands were lost, one of which was a woman, who reportedly floated to shore dead but still tied to the mast.   It is, however, possible that this detail was taken from a different ship that foundered during the same storm.\n“The Wreck of the Hesperus” is based on two events: an actual shipwreck at Norman’s Woe, after which a body like the one in the poem was found, and the real wreck of the Hesperus, which took place near Boston. Despite that fact, the poem is so well known that the loop road leading close to Norman’s Woe from Route 127 is named Hesperus Ave. \n\nIn December 1839, Longfellow wrote in his diary about the writing of \"The Wreck of the Hesperus\":\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" was adapted into films of the same name in 1927  and 1948.  In the 1975 Australian film, Picnic at Hanging Rock, the headmistress forbids a student from participating in a school outing because she has failed to memorize lines from the poem. In Kevin Sullivan's 1985 film of Anne of Green Gables, a character recites \"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" prior to Anne's rousing rendition of \"The Highwayman\". \"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" is referenced in the comic song \"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\" by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, performed by Groucho Marx in the movie At the Circus (1939), by Virginia Weidler in The Philadelphia Story (1940),  by Robin Williams in  The Fisher King (1991), as well as Kermit the Frog in The Muppet Show, and in an episode of Homeland (ep. 2x06).\n\n\"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\", Groucho Marx's signature song, places the Wreck of the Hesperus on Lydia's back, next to the Battle of Waterloo.  The enchanting Lydia once swept an Admiral clear off his feet. The ships on her hips made his heart skip a beat, And now the old boy's in command of the fleet, For he went and married Lydia.\n\nThe title phrase is sometimes used colloquially to indicate a disheveled appearance. In the film The Big Circus (1959), one character tells another: \"I didn't bring the rain and you're beginning to look like the wreck of the Hesperus.\"\n\nThe Pleasure Island amusement park in Wakefield, Massachusetts (1958 - 1970), 18 miles south-west of the site where the fictional Hesparus sank, featured a ride named \"The Wreck of the Hesperus\". \n\nThe rock band Procol Harum included their song \"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" on their album A Salty Dog, released in 1969. George Harrison included his song \"Wreck of the Hesperus\" on his 1987 album Cloud Nine. The English poet Roger McGough recited a one-minute version of the poem, complete with sound effects, on the album \"Miniatures\" produced by Morgan Fisher in 1980.\n\nMad magazine parodied the poem by presenting the text with outlandish illustrations by Wallace Wood, including a pint-sized captain and a hideous, tall daughter, who survives the storms and strides away still tied to the mast.\n\nWreck of the Hesperus is the name of an Irish doom/drone metal band.\n\nAlthough identical in nearly every respect to the initiation rites of \"Crossing the Desert\" and the \"Unblinking Eye\", the \"Wreck of the Hesperus\" is a possibly superfluous ordeal suffered by Homer Simpson as part of his acceptance into the secret society of Stonecutters. The ordeal requires that the initiate walk a line blindfolded while other Stonecutters swiftly strike the initiate's buttocks with cricket bats. It is generally the penultimate trial, followed only by the ordeal \"The Paddling of the Swollen Ass (with Paddles)\".\nQuestion:\n\"Who wrote the poem \"\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\"\" in 1842?\"\nAnswer:\nHenry Wadsworth\nPassage:\nAve Maria (Schubert)\n\"\" (\"\", D. 839, Op. 52, No. 6, 1825), in English: \"Ellen's Third Song\", was composed by Franz Schubert in 1825 as part of his Opus 52, a setting of seven songs from Walter Scott's popular epic poem The Lady of the Lake, loosely translated into German.\n\nIt has become one of Schubert's most popular works, recorded by a wide variety and large number of singers, under the title of \"Ave Maria\", in arrangements with various lyrics which commonly differ from the original context of the poem. It was arranged in three versions for piano by Franz Liszt.\n\nThe Lady of the Lake and the \"Ave Maria\"\n\nThe piece was composed as a setting of a song (verse XXIX from Canto Third) from Walter Scott's popular epic poem The Lady of the Lake,  in a German translation by  (1780–1822),  and thus forms part of Schubert's '. In Scott's poem the character Ellen Douglas, the Lady of the Lake (Loch Katrine in the Scottish Highlands), has gone with her exiled father to stay in the Goblin's cave as he has declined to join their previous host, Roderick Dhu, in rebellion against King James. Roderick Dhu, the chieftain of Clan Alpine, sets off up the mountain with his warriors, but lingers and hears the distant sound of the harpist Allan-bane, accompanying Ellen who sings a prayer addressed to the Virgin Mary, calling upon her for help. Roderick Dhu pauses, then goes on to battle. \n\nSchubert's arrangement is said to have first been performed at the castle of Countess Sophie Weissenwolff in the little Austrian town of Steyregg and dedicated to her, which led to her becoming known as \"the lady of the lake\" herself. \n\nThe opening words and refrain of Ellen's song, namely \"Ave Maria\" (Latin for \"Hail Mary\"), may have led to the idea of adapting Schubert's melody as a setting for the full text of the traditional Roman Catholic prayer \"Ave Maria\". The Latin version of the \"Ave Maria\" is now so frequently used with Schubert's melody that it has led to the misconception that he originally wrote the melody as a setting for the \"Ave Maria\".\n\nPosition within the cycle\n\nIn 1825, Schubert composed a selection of seven songs from Scott's The Lady of the Lake. They were published in 1826 as his Opus 52.\n\nThe songs are not intended for a single performer: the three songs of Ellen are piano songs for a woman's voice, while the songs for Norman and the Count of Douglas were intended for the baritone Johann Michael Vogl. The remaining two songs are written one for a male and the other for a female ensemble.\n\n# \"Ellens Gesang I\", D. 837, Raste Krieger, Krieg ist aus / \"Soldier rest! the warfare o’er\"\n# \"Ellens Gesang II\", D. 838, Jäger, ruhe von der Jagd / \"Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done\"\n# \"Bootgesang\", D. 835, Triumph, er naht / \"Hail to the chief\", for male voice quartet\n# \"Coronach\" (Deathsong of the women and girls), D. 836, Er ist uns geschieden / \"He is gone to the mountain\", for female choir\n# \"Normans Gesang\", D. 846, Die Nacht bricht bald herein (\"Night will soon be falling\")\n# \"Ellens Gesang III\" (Hymn to the Virgin), D. 839, Ave Maria! Jungfrau mild! / \"Ave Maria! maiden mild!\"\n# \"Lied des gefangenen Jägers\", D. 843, Mein Roß so müd / \"My steed is tired\"\n\nSchubert composed the songs to the German texts. However, with the exception of No. 5, the songs were clearly intended to be published with the original English texts as well. This meant finding correspondences to Storck's sometimes quite free translations, which entailed significant difficulties.\n\nLyrics\n\nUse in Disney's Fantasia\n\nWalt Disney used Schubert's song in the final part of his 1940 film Fantasia, where he linked it to Modest Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain in one of his most famous pastiches. The end of Mussorgsky's work blends with almost no break into the beginning of Schubert's song, and as Deems Taylor remarked, the bells in Night on Bald Mountain, originally meant to signal the coming of dawn, which cause the demon Chernobog to stop his dark worship and the ghosts to return to the grave, now seem to be church bells signalling the beginning of religious services. A procession of monks is shown walking along. The text for this version is sung in English, and was written by Rachel Field.  This version also had three stanzas, like Schubert's original, but only the third stanza made it into the film (one line in the last stanza is partially repeated to show how it is sung in the film):\n\nThe version heard in Fantasia was arranged by Leopold Stokowski especially for the film, and unlike the original, which is for a solo voice, is scored for soprano and mixed chorus, accompanied by the string section of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The soloist is Julietta Novis. The Ave Maria sequence was later featured in Very Merry Christmas Songs, which is part of Disney Sing-Along Songs, as a background movie for the song Silent Night.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nPublished in 1826 whose song, a rendition of 'Ave Maria', is classified as Opus 52 no 6?\nAnswer:\nGraz Waltzes\nPassage:\nVeronica Lario\nVeronica Lario (born on 19 July 1956 as Miriam Raffaella Bartolini) is a former Italian actress and the former wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Bologna, Lario was an actress in low-budget films. She also worked in theatrical plays with well-known actors; she retired from acting after meeting Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nMarried on 15 December 1990, Berlusconi and Lario have three children together: Barbara Berlusconi (1984),At this time Silvio Berlusconi was still married to Carla Elvira Lucia Dall'Oglio, from whom he was divorced in 1985. Eleonora (1986), and Luigi (1988). In the 80s, before the birth of the first-born daughter Barbara, Lario terminated an earlier pregnancy with an induced abortion, in order not to give birth to a child affected by significant morbidity. \n\nAs the wife of the Italian premier, Veronica Lario has chosen to maintain a low public profile. She has avoided most public events and meetings and she seldom accompanies her husband Silvio Berlusconi at official meetings. On the other hand, she has been known to have publicly expressed political opinions contrasting with those of her husband (for example, on bioethics or in backing for protesters demonstrating against the war in Iraq ).\n\nLario's husband was never shy about mentioning her on public occasions, and he has alluded at least once to a supposed affair between her and opposition politician Massimo Cacciari.While the supposed affair was only mentioned in gossip tabloids, on October 2002, during a press conference with Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Silvio Berlusconi said he ought to introduce his wife to Rasmussen, \"the best-looking prime minister in Europe and certainly more handsome than Cacciari\". See also [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,1005001,00.html the Guardian] on this episode.\n\nOn 31 January 2007, Lario said her dignity had been damaged by comments Berlusconi reportedly made during the VIP party after a TV awards ceremony broadcast by one of his channels.\n\n\"If I weren't married I would marry you immediately\", the 70-year-old media mogul told showgirl and future parliamentarian Mara Carfagna, according to reports widely carried in the Italian press. He reportedly told another, \"With you, I'd go anywhere\".\n\nLario's letter appeared in La Repubblica, a nationally prominent newspaper. She declared:\n\nI see these statements as damaging my dignity. To both my husband and the public man, I therefore demand a public apology, since I haven't received any privately. I have faced the inevitable contrasts and the more painful moments that a long conjugal relation entails with respect and discretion.\n\n\"Now I write to state my reaction,\" added Lario, saying her husband's comments were \"unacceptable\" and could not be reduced to mere jokes.\n\nBut after few hours, Silvio Berlusconi wrote back a public letter to his wife and apologized for what he had said three days before.\n\nIn April 2009 she once more published an open letter, criticising her husband for consorting with young ladies  and defining his chosen candidates for the European Parliament as \"shameless rubbish\".\n\nOn 3 May 2009 it was reported that she is to file for divorce,  which under Italian law can only be started after a couple has reached a separation agreement. On 10 May 2010 it was revealed that a separation settlement had been reached, with Berlusconi accepting alimony payments of €3,6 million per year, and allowing her to live in their luxury home near Milan. \n\nIn December 2012 Milan court established that Silvio Berlusconi will pay his ex-wife Veronica Lario €3 million a month (36 million a year).\nQuestion:\nVeronica Lario was much in the news as the angry wife of which womanising European leader?\nAnswer:\nBerusconi\nPassage:\nA Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday)\n\"A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday)\" is a 1963 song issued as the B-side to Motown singing group Martha and the Vandellas' hit single, \"Heat Wave\", released on the Gordy label. \n\nThe song, written and produced by Vandellas cohorts, Holland–Dozier–Holland, is a song where a woman praises her lover for loving her after she \"broke (his) heart and made (him) blue\" saying afterwards \"instead of hurting back\" telling her he loved her.\n\nThe song, while not released as a single, is regarded as a sixties classic with notable covers by Dusty Springfield, Harry Nilsson and Cher, Juice Newton, Manfred Mann, and the Animals.   Ike & Tina Turner released it as a single from their album River Deep – Mountain High. Ike & Tina's version was the only version that became a charted hit peaking at #16 on the UK pop charts. \n\nCredits\n\n*Lead vocals and spoken monologues by Martha Reeves\n*Background vocals by Rosalind Ashford, Annette Beard, and Brian Holland\n*Produced by Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier\n*Written by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Edward Holland, Jr.\n*Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers\n\nChart history (Ike & Tina version)\nQuestion:\nWho dueted with Harry Nilsson on the 1975 Phil Spectre song 'A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Every Day)' ?\nAnswer:\nCher (singer)\nPassage:\nWedding anniversary\nA wedding anniversary is the anniversary of the date a marriage took place. Traditional names exist for all of them: for instance, 50 years of marriage is called a \"golden wedding anniversary\" or simply a \"golden anniversary.\" Twenty-five years is called a \"silver wedding anniversary\" or \"silver anniversary.\" Sixty years is a \"diamond wedding anniversary\" or  \"diamond anniversary\". First year anniversary is called a \"Paper Anniversary.\"\n\nOfficial recognition\n\nThe historic origins of wedding anniversaries date back to the Holy Roman Empire, when husbands crowned their wives with a silver wreath on their twenty-fifth anniversary, and a gold wreath on the fiftieth. Later, principally in the twentieth century, commercialism led to the addition of more anniversaries being represented by a named gift. \n\nIn the Commonwealth realms, one can receive a message from the monarch for 60th, 65th, and 70th wedding anniversaries, and any wedding anniversary after that.  This is done by applying to Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom, or to the Governor-General's office in the other Commonwealth realms. \n\nIn Australia, where one can receive a letter of congratulations from the Governor-General on the 50th and all subsequent wedding anniversaries; the Prime Minister, the federal Opposition leader, local members of both state and federal parliaments, and state Governors may also send salutations for the same anniversaries. \n\nIn Canada, one can also receive a message from the Governor-General for the 50th anniversary, and every fifth anniversary after that. \n\nIn the United States, a couple can receive a greeting from the President for any wedding anniversary on or after the 50th. \n\nRoman Catholics may apply to the Office of Papal Charities for a Papal blessing for wedding anniversaries of a special nature (25th, 50th, 60th, etc.).  \n\nCelebration and gifts\n\nThe names of some anniversaries provide guidance for appropriate or traditional gifts for the spouses to give each other; if there is a party these can be brought by the guests or influence the theme or decoration. These gifts vary in different countries, but some years have well-established connections now common to most nations: 5th Wooden, 10th Tin, 15th Crystal, 20th China, 25th Silver, 30th Pearl, 40th Ruby, 50th Gold, 60th Diamond, 70th Platinum. In English speaking countries the first, wooden, gift was cut on the day of celebration and then presented to the wife as a finished article before the next two quarter days had passed. The tradition may have originated in medieval Germany where, if a married couple lived to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their wedding, the wife was presented by her friends and neighbours with a silver wreath to congratulate them for the good fortune that had prolonged the lives of the couple. Over time the number of symbols expanded and the German tradition came to assign gifts that had direct connections with each stage of married life. The symbols have changed over time. For example, in the United Kingdom, diamond was a well known symbol for the 75th anniversary, but this changed to the now more common 60th anniversary after Diamond Anniversary of Queen Victoria. The current monarch Queen Elizabeth II's 60th year on the throne was widely marked as her Diamond Jubilee and commemorated in 2012.\n\nAnniversary Gift Lists \n\nLists of wedding anniversary gifts vary by country. The traditional and modern U.S. versions were compiled by librarians at the Chicago Public Library.    \n\nFlower gifts\n\nGemstone Jewelry Anniversary gifts\n\nFor lovers of jewelry, the Jewelry Anniversary list with gemstone jewelry for each anniversary year was established by The American Gem Society, The Gemological Institute of America, The American Gem Trade Association, Jewelers of America, and the International Colored Gemstone Association.\nQuestion:\nHow many Years of marriage does a crystal wedding anniversary celebrate?\nAnswer:\nfifteen\nPassage:\nTo the Finland Station\nTo the Finland Station: A Study in the Writing and Acting of History (1940) is a book by American critic and historian Edmund Wilson. The work presents the history of revolutionary thought and the birth of socialism, from the French Revolution through the collaboration of Marx and Engels to the arrival of Lenin at the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal in St. Petersburg in 1917.\n\nForm and Content\n\nWilson \"had the present book in mind for six years,\"  which Robert Giroux edited. \n\nThe book is divided into three sections.\n\nThe first spends five of eight chapters on Michelet and then discusses the \"Decline of Revolutionary Tradition\" vis-a-vis Ernest Renan, Hippolyte Taine, and Anatole France.\n\nThe second deals with Socialism and Communism in sixteen chapters. The first four chapters discuss the \"Origins of Socialism\" vis-a-vis Babeuf, Saint-Simon, Fourier and Robert Owen, and Enfantin and \"American Socialists\" (Margaret Sanger and Horace Greeley). The second group of twelve chapters deal mostly with the development of thought in Karl Marx in light of his influences, partnership with Friedrich Engels and opposition from Lassalle and Bakunin.\n\nThe third spends six chapters, dealing two each on Lenin, Trotsky, and again Lenin. Important writings addressed include Lenin's \"What Is to Be Done?\" and Trotsky's Literature and Revolution, My Life, biography of Lenin, and The History of the Russian Revolution.\n\nThe book also mentions Eleanor Marx, Nadezhda Krupskaya, Annie Besant, Charles Bradlaugh and Georgy Gapon.\n\nPublication\n\nHarcourt, Brace & Co. first published this book in September 1940.  Doubleday's Anchor Books imprint published a paperback edition in 1953.  Farrar, Straus and Giroux published a paperback edition in 1972.  The New York Review of Books published a new edition in 2003, with an introduction by Louis Menand. \n\nUpon publication, TIME said: Because it makes Marxist theory, aims and tactics intelligible to any literate non-Marxist mind, To the Finland Station is an invaluable book. It is an advantage that, like Milton with the character of Satan, Author Wilson is half in love with the human side of the curious specimens he describes.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n\nThis book is mentioned as the reading matter of a young Bill Clinton in Hillary Clinton's biography 'Living History'.\nQuestion:\nThe 1940 book To the Finland Station by Edmund Wilson that traces communism refers to the arrival of Lenin at the said railway station in what city?\nAnswer:\nSt Petersb.\nPassage:\nTokophobia\nTokophobia, or the fear of pregnancy and childbirth, is the suggested name for a form of specific phobia. It is also known as \"maleusiophobia\" (though this is certainly a variant of \"maieusiophobia\", from the Greek \"maieusis\", literally meaning \"delivery of a woman in childbirth\"  but referring generally to midwifery), \"parturiphobia\" (from Latin \"parturire\" meaning \"to be pregnant\",  and \"lockiophobia\". \n\nPsychological disorder\n\nIn 2000, an article published in the British Journal of Psychiatry (2000, 176: 83-85 ) described the fear of childbirth as a psychological disorder that has received little attention and may be overlooked. The article introduced the term tokophobia in the medical literature (from the Greek tokos, meaning childbirth and phobos, meaning fear).\n\nPhobia of pregnancy and childbirth, as with any phobia, can manifest through a number of symptoms including nightmares, difficulty in concentrating on work or on family activities, panic attacks and psychosomatic complaints. Often the fear of childbirth motivates a request for an elective caesarean section.  Fear of labor pain is strongly associated with the fear of pain in general; a previous complicated childbirth, or inadequate pain relief, may cause the phobia to develop. A fear of pregnancy itself can result in an avoidance of pregnancy or even, as birth control methods are never 100% effective, an avoidance of sexual intercourse or asking for hysterectomy.\n\nTokophobia is a distressing psychological disorder which may be overlooked by medical professionals; as well as specific phobia and anxiety disorders, tokophobia may be associated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Recognition of tokophobia and close liaison with obstetricians or other medical specialists can help to reduce its severity and ensure efficient treatment.  \n\nPrimary and secondary tokophobia\n\n*Primary tokophobia is the fear and deep-seated dread of childbirth which pre-dates pregnancy and can start in adolescence. This often relates back to their own mother's experience or something they learned in school.\n*Secondary tokophobia is due to previous experience of traumatic birth, poor obstetric practice or medical attention, postpartum depression or other such upsetting events.\n\nA few reactions to childbirth include the following:\n\n\"The truth is that the very thought of having something almost alien-like growing inside me is disgusting.\"\n\"It's not too strong to say that the very thought of childbirth disgusts me in a big way.\"\n\"It's much more than an anxiety – I am actually physically repulsed by pregnancy and childbirth.\"\n\"I even struggle to be around friends when they are pregnant and can't bear to watch or listen to anything about the process of having a baby.\"\nQuestion:\nWhat is tocophobia a fear of?\nAnswer:\nIn labor\nPassage:\nTommy and Tuppence\nTommy and Tuppence are two fictional detectives, recurring characters in the work of Agatha Christie. Their full names are Thomas Beresford and Prudence Beresford (née Cowley).\nThe first time Tommy and Tuppence appeared in a Christie novel was in The Secret Adversary (1922). They started out their career as accidental blackmailers  (all in search of adventure and money), but the detecting life soon proved more profitable and much more exciting.\n\nNovels\n\nTommy and Tuppence appear together in four full-length novels and one collection of short stories    The collection of short stories is Partners in Crime, (1929, each story reminiscent of another writer's work); the four novels are The Secret Adversary (1922),  N or M? (1941), By the Pricking of My Thumbs (1968); and Postern of Fate (1973).  Postern of Fate was the last novel Christie ever wrote, although not the last to be published.\n\nDetectives\n\nTuppence appears as a charismatic, impulsive and intuitive person, while Tommy is less imaginative, and less likely to be diverted from the truth (as their first adversary sums him up \"he is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to the facts\"). They therefore make a good team. It is in this first book The Secret Adversary that they meet up after the war, and come to realise that, although they have been friends for most of their lives, they have now fallen in love with each other.\n\nUnlike many other recurring detective characters, including the better known Christie detectives, Tommy and Tuppence aged in time with the real world, being in their early twenties in The Secret Adversary and in their seventies in Postern of Fate. In their early appearances, they are portrayed as typical upper middle class \"bright young things\" of the 1920s,  and the stories and settings have a more pronounced period-specific flavour than the stories featuring the better known Christie characters. As they age, they're revealed to have raised three children – twins Deborah and Derek and an adopted daughter, Betty. Throughout the series they employ a man named Albert, who first appears as a lift boy who helps them in The Secret Adversary; and subsequently, as a now married pub owner, renders vital assistance to the pair in N or M?. In Partners in Crime, Albert becomes their hapless assistant at a private detective agency; by Postern of Fate he's their butler and has now been widowed. In Postern of Fate they also have a small dog named Hannibal.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1953 the BBC adapted Partners in Crime as a radio series starring Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim.\n\nThe Tommy and Tuppence characters have been portrayed on television by James Warwick and Francesca Annis, first in the feature-length The Secret Adversary (1982), and then in the 10 episode series Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime (1983).\n\nThe novel By the Pricking of My Thumbs was adapted in 2005 by the French director Pascal Thomas with the title Mon petit doigt m'a dit.... The movie casts André Dussolier as Tommy (renamed Bélisaire) and Catherine Frot as Prudence Beresford. The action is transposed to Savoie in France. A second movie, Le crime est notre affaire, came out in 2008. Le crime est notre affaire is named after Partners in Crime and stars the Beresfords, but its story is based on 4.50 From Paddington, which was originally a novel starring Miss Marple. A third film Associés contre le crime is very, very loosely based (to the point of being unrecognisable) on one of the stories in Partners in Crime.\n\nAn adaptation of By the Pricking of My Thumbs appeared in 2006 as an episode of the Granada television series Marple even though Christie did not write Marple into the original story. In this version, Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi respectively, but, unlike in the book, Miss Marple and Tuppence play the detective roles while Tommy is away on intelligence (MI6) business.\n\nBBC television began broadcasting two adaptations, comprising six episodes in 2015. Set in the 1950s and titled Partners in Crime, it starred David Walliams as Tommy  and Jessica Raine as Tuppence.\nQuestion:\n\"Who plays the part of Tommy Beresford in the BBC series \"\"Partners in Crime\"\", based on an Agatha Christie novel?\"\nAnswer:\nDavid Walliams\nPassage:\nBulbul\nBulbuls are a family, Pycnonotidae, of medium-sized passerine songbirds. Many forest species are known as greenbuls, brownbuls, leafloves, or bristlebills. The family is distributed across most of Africa and into the Middle East, tropical Asia to Indonesia, and north as far as Japan. A few insular species occur on the tropical islands of the Indian Ocean There are about 130 species in around 24 genera. While some species are found in most habitats, overall African species are predominantly found in rainforest whilst rainforest species are rare in Asia, instead preferring  more open areas.\n\nThe word bulbul derives from , meaning nightingale, but in English, bulbul refers to passerine birds of a different family.\n\nDescription\n\nBulbuls are short-necked slender passerines. The tails are long and the wings short and rounded. In almost all species the bill is slightly elongated and slightly hooked at the end. They vary in length from 13 cm for the tiny greenbul to 29 cm in the straw-headed bulbul. Overall the sexes are alike, although the females tend to be slightly smaller. In a few species the differences are so great that they have been described as functionally different species. The soft plumage of some species is colourful with yellow, red or orange vents, cheeks, throat or supercilia, but most are drab, with uniform olive-brown to black plumage. Species with dull coloured eyes often sport contrasting eyerings. Some have very distinct crests. Bulbuls are highly vocal, with the calls of most species being described as nasal or gravelly. One author described the song of the brown-eared bulbul as \"the most unattractive noises made by any bird\".Fishpool et al. (2005)  \n\nBulbuls eat a wide range of different foods, ranging from fruit to seeds, nectar, small insects and other arthropods and even small vertebrates. The majority of species are frugivorous and supplement their diet with some insects, whilst there is a significant minority of specialists, particularly in Africa. Open country species in particular are generalists. Bulbuls in the genus Criniger and bristlebills in the genus Bleda will join mixed-species feeding flocks.\n\nThe bulbuls are generally monogamous. One unusual exception is the yellow-whiskered greenbul which at least over part of its range appears to be polygamous and engage in a lekking system. Some species also have alloparenting arrangements, where non-breeders, usually the young from earlier clutches, help raise the young of a dominant breeding pair.  Up to five purple-pink eggs are laid in an open tree nests and incubated by the female. Incubation usually lasts between 11–14 days, and chicks fledge after 12–16 days.\n\nSystematics\n\nThe traditional layout was to divide the bulbuls into four groups, named Pycnonotus, Phyllastrephus, Criniger, and Chlorocichla groups after characteristic genera (Delacour, 1943). However, more recent analyses demonstrated that this arrangement was probably based on erroneous interpretation of characters:\n\nComparison of mtDNA cytochrome b sequences found that five species of Phyllastrephus did not belong to the bulbuls, but to an enigmatic group of songbirds from Madagascar instead (Cibois et al., 2001; see below for the species in question), and they are now usually referred to as Malagasy warblers. Similarly, sequence analysis of the nDNA RAG1 and RAG2 genes suggests that the genus Nicator is not a bulbul either (Beresford et al., 2005). That the previous arrangement had failed to take into account biogeography was indicated by the study of Pasquet et al. (2001) who demonstrated the genus Criniger must be divided into an African and an Asian (Alophoixus) lineage. Using analysis of one nDNA and 2 mtDNA sequences, Moyle & Marks (2006) found one largely Asian lineage and one African group of greenbuls and bristlebills; the golden greenbul seemes to be very distinct and form a group of its own. Some taxa are not monophyletic, and more research is necessary to determine relationships within the larger genera.\n\nSystematic list\n\nBasal\n* Genus Calyptocichla\n** Golden greenbul, Calyptocichla serina\n\nTypical bulbuls\n\n* Genus Pycnonotus (paraphyletic) (approx. 40 species depending on classification)\n\n* Genus Spizixos – finchbills (2 species)\n** Crested finchbill, Spizixos canifrons\n** Collared finchbill, Spizixos semitorques\n* Genus Tricholestes – hairy-backed bulbul\n* Genus Setornis – hook-billed bulbul\n* Genus Alophoixus (formerly in Criniger, possibly polyphyletic)\n** Finsch's bulbul, Alophoixus finschii\n** White-throated bulbul, Alophoixus flaveolus\n** Puff-throated bulbul, Alophoixus pallidus\n** Ochraceous bulbul, Alophoixus ochraceus\n** Grey-cheeked bulbul, Alophoixus bres\n** Palawan bulbul, Alophoixus frater\n** Yellow-bellied bulbul, Alophoixus phaeocephalus\n** Seram golden bulbul, Alophoixus affinis\n** Northern golden bulbul, Alophoixus longirostris\n** Buru golden bulbul, Alophoixus mysticalis\n* Genus Iole (5 species, sometimes in Hypsipetes/Ixos)\n* Genus Hemixos (2 species, sometimes in Hypsipetes/Ixos)\n* Genus Ixos (paraphyletic, might include Hypsipetes)\n** Streaked bulbul, Ixos malaccensis\n** Mountain bulbul, Ixos mcclellandii\n** Sunda bulbul, Ixos virescens\n** Nicobar bulbul, Ixos nicobariensis\n* Genus Hypsipetes (16 species, might belong in Ixos)\n\nTypical greenbuls and allies\n* Genus Phyllastrephus (19 species)\n* Genus Arizelocichla (5–8 species)\n* Genus Andropadus – sombre greenbul\n* Genus Eurillas (5 species)\n* Genus Stelgidillas – slender-billed greenbul\n* Genus Criniger (5 species)\n* Genus Thescelocichla – swamp palm bulbul\n* Genus Chlorocichla (5 species)\n* Genus Atimastillas – yellow-throated leaflove\n* Genus Ixonotus  – spotted greenbul (tentatively placed here)\n* Genus Baeopogon (2 species)\n* Genus Bleda – bristlebills (3–4 species)\n\nIncertae sedis\n* Genus Neolestes\n** Black-collared bulbul, Neolestes torquatus\n\nThis might be allied to Calyptocichla or not be a bulbul at all.\n\nRelationship to humans\n\nThe red-whiskered bulbuls and red-vented bulbuls have been captured for the pet trade in great numbers and, has been widely introduced to tropical and subtropical areas, for example southern Florida, Fiji, Australia and Hawaii. Some species are regarded as crop pests, particularly in orchards.\n\nIn general bulbuls and greenbuls are resistant to human pressures on the environment and are tolerant of disturbed habitat. Around 13 species are considered threatened by human activities, mostly specialised forest species threatened by habitat loss.\nQuestion:\nWhat type of creature is a bulbul?\nAnswer:\nAvians\n\n\nPassage:\nLittle Miss Muffet - Poetry Foundation\nLittle Miss Muffet by Mother Goose | Poetry Foundation\nLittle Miss Muffet by Mother Goose\nEating her curds and whey;\nAlong came a spider,\nWho sat down beside her,\nAnd frightened Miss Muffet away.\nSource: The Dorling Kindersley Book of Nursery Rhymes (2000)\nDiscover this poem's context and related poetry, articles, and media.\nPoet\nBiography\nMother Goose is often cited as the author of hundreds of children’s stories that have been passed down through oral tradition and published over centuries.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nThe Housemartins\nThe Housemartins were an English alternative rock band formed in Hull who were active in the 1980s.  Many of the Housemartins' lyrics were a mixture of Marxist politics and Christianity, reflecting singer Paul Heaton's beliefs at the time (the back cover of London 0 Hull 4 contained the message, \"Take Jesus – Take Marx – Take Hope\"). The group's cover version of the Isley Brothers'  \"Caravan of Love\" was a UK Number 1 single in December 1986.\n\nCareer\n\nFormation\n\nThe band was formed in late 1983 by Paul Heaton (vocals) and Stan Cullimore (guitar), initially as a busking duo. Throughout his tenure with the band, Heaton billed himself as \"P.d. Heaton\".  \n\nHeaton and Cullimore recorded a demo tape with Ingo Dewsnap of Les Zeiga Fleurs which brought them to the attention of Go! Discs. They then expanded by recruiting Ted Key (bass), former guitarist with The Gargoyles, and Justin Patrick [drummer on loan from Udomsuksa!] who was then replaced by Chris Lang. Their first live performance as a band was at Hull University in October 1984.  The band's membership changed considerably over the years. Key left at the end of 1985 and was replaced by Norman Cook (the future Fatboy Slim). Drummer Chris Lang was replaced by Hugh Whitaker, former drummer with The Gargoyles, who in turn was replaced with Dave Hemingway.\n\nThe band often referred to themselves as \"the fourth best band in Hull\". The three bands that were \"better\" were Red Guitars, Everything but the Girl and The Gargoyles.\n\nBreak \n\nIn 1986, having recorded two John Peel sessions, the band broke through with the single \"Happy Hour\", which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.  The single's success was helped by a claymation animated pop promo of a type that was in vogue at the time, featuring a cameo by television comedian Phill Jupitus, who toured with the band under his stage name of \"Porky the Poet\".\n\nCaravan of Love \n\nAt the end of 1986 they had their only UK No. 1 single on 16 December with a cover version of Isley-Jasper-Isley's \"Caravan of Love\". It was knocked off the top spot by Jackie Wilson's \"Reet Petite\" on 23 December, denying the Housemartins the coveted Christmas No. 1 single.\n\nThe a cappella style of \"Caravan of Love\" was not to the taste of all Housemartins' fans, although a cappella material had always been part of the band's repertoire. \"Caravan of Love\" was first performed by the band in their second Peel session in April 1986, prior to their initial chart success. At Peel's suggestion, the band then recorded another session (under the name The Fish City Five), consisting entirely of a cappella performances, and on at least one occasion (at The Tower nightclub in Hull, the same concert at which they were filmed as the Housemartins for the BBC programme, Rock Around the Clock), played support act for their own performance under this alternative name.  The \"Caravan of Love\" single featured four a cappella gospel songs on the B-side.\n\nSplit\n\nThe band split in 1988, but the members have remained friends and have worked on each other's projects. Norman Cook has enjoyed significant success with Beats International and then as Fatboy Slim, while Heaton, Hemingway and roadie Sean Welch formed The Beautiful South.\n\nIn August 2009, Mojo magazine arranged for The Housemartins' original members to get together for a photo-shoot and interview, for the first time in many years, but in the interview all the members maintained that the band would not re-form.\n\nIn December 2009, Cullimore co-wrote songs for (and appeared in) a pre-school music series called The Bopps, which first showed on Nick Jr. in the UK in April 2010.\n\nCullimore and Whitaker joined Heaton on stage during a show by Heaton and Jacqui Abbott in 2014, although it was not a Housemartins reunion. The trio performed the Housemartins hit \"Me and the Farmer\", and Cullimore and Heaton closed the show with a performance of \"Caravan of Love\". \n\nLondon 0 Hull 4 re-release\n\nLondon 0 Hull 4 was re-released on 22 June 2009, with a bonus disc featuring tracks released as additional content on 12-inch singles and demo tracks.\n\nMusical style and lyrics\n\nThe band's early releases saw them described as jangle pop, which brought comparisons with bands such as The Smiths and Aztec Camera.   David Quantick, writing for Spin, described them in 1986 as playing \"traditional '60s-style guitar pop overlaid with soul vocals\".  Cook described the band as \"religious, but not Christians\", and the band's repertoire included Gospel songs.\n\nMany of the band's lyrics have socialist themes, with Cook stating that \"Paul realized that he hated writing about love...and that writing politically came easier to him\", describing some of their songs as \"angrily political\". \n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nCompilation albums\n\n* The Housemartins Christmas Box Set (November 1986) UK #84\n*Now That's What I Call Quite Good (April 1988) UK #8\n*The Best of the Housemartins (March 2004) UK #29\n*Live at the BBC (2006, Universal)\n*Soup (December 2007) UK # 15\n*Happy Hour: The Collection (July 2011)\n\nVideography\n\n(does not include \"live\" appearances on TV programmes)\n* \"Sheep\"\n* \"Happy Hour\"\n* \"Think for a Minute\"\n* \"Caravan of Love\"\n* \"Five Get Over Excited\"\n* \"Me and the Farmer\"\n* \"Build\"\n* \"There Is Always Something There to Remind Me\"\n* \"We're Not Deep\"\n\nBiography\n\n* The Housemartins: Now That's What I Call Quite Good by Nick Swift (1988) ISBN 0-7119-1517-2\nQuestion:\nWhich British group was formed by former members of 'The Housemartins', Paul Heaton and David Hemingway?\nAnswer:\nThe Beautiful South\nPassage:\nJim Morrison Died Here: 17 Rue Beautreillis In Paris ...\nJim Morrison Died Here: 17 Rue Beautreillis In Paris, France On July 3, 1971 | FeelNumb.com\nJim Morrison Died Here: 17 Rue Beautreillis In Paris, France On July 3, 1971\nBy raul on January 30, 2010 in Died Here , Jim Morrison , Location , The Doors\nOn July 3, 1971, Jim Morrison died in the bathtub of this rented apartment on 17 Rue Beautreillis Paris, France 75004.\nOn the night of his death, Morrison had been coughing badly after a night out drinking.  He had gone to take a bath after accidentally snorting heroin that he thought was cocaine and vomited blood.

However, despite her assertion and references to that assertion in articles by journalists, Porter did not write \"Miss Otis Regrets\" for Bricktop.  According to Charles Schwartz's book Cole Porter: A Biography (Da Capo Press, 1979; ISBN 9780306800979), the song began during a party at the New York apartment of Porter's classmate from Yale, Leonard Hanna. Hearing a cowboy's lament  on the radio, Porter sat down at the piano and improvised a parody of the song. He retained the referential song’s minor-keyed blues melody, and added his wry take on lyrical subject matter common in country music: the regret of abandonment after being deceitfully coerced into sexual submission. Only instead of a country girl, Miss Otis is a polite society lady. \n\nFriend and Yale classmate Monty Woolley jumped in to help Porter \"sell it\", pretending to be a butler who explains why Madam can't keep a lunch appointment. In the previous 24 hours, Miss Otis was jilted and abandoned, located and killed her seducer, was arrested, jailed, and, about to be hanged by a mob, made a final, polite apology for being unable to keep her lunch appointment. This performance was so well received, that the song evolved, \"workshopped\" with each subsequent cocktail party, many of which were at the Waldorf-Astoria suite of Elsa Maxwell, to whom Porter dedicated the song. The \"smart set\" that attended these parties, known to use wit or wisecracks to punctuate anecdotes and gossip, began using references to \"Miss Otis\" as a punchline. [http://books.google.com/books?id=RloVVG_FzkAC Porter incorporated the tale of \"Miss Otis Regrets\" into Hi Diddle Diddle later that year.]\n\n“Miss Otis” entered the lexicon of American pop culture, its enormous popularity and commercial success indicated when, a year later, Al Dubin and Harry Warren included an homage to Miss Otis in their song \"Lulu's Back In Town\", written for the 1935 film Broadway Gondolier. A man sings about getting ready for a date with Lulu, focusing all his attention on this awesome girl who's visiting town after having moved away: \"You can tell all my pets, all my blondes and brunettes, Mister Otis regrets that he won't be around.”\n\nTruman Capote, in his article published in the November 1975 issue of Esquire Magazine, relates a story Porter told him. Porter used \"Miss Otis\" as a punchline in the 1950s, opening the door to dismiss a presumptuous man from his home, Porter handed him a check as he said \"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today. Now get out.\" \n\nThe song was recorded by Alberta Hunter with Jack Jackson and His Orchestra and Ethel Waters with The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra, both in 1934; Charles Trenet, Cab Calloway and His Orchestra in 1935; Édith Piaf (as \"Miss Otis Regrette\")  in 1946; Marlene Dietrich sang it as \"\"Mein Mann ist verhindert\" (written in German by Lothar Metzl) with Jimmy Carroll & Orchestra in 1951; Frances Faye in 1953; Ella Fitzgerald in 1956; Fred Astaire in 1960; Nancy Wilson in 1962; Tammy Grimes in 1963; Nat King Cole in 1966; Jose Feliciano in 1969; The Lemonheads in 1993; Kirsty MacColl in 1995; Linda Ronstadt in 1998; Bryan Ferry in 1999; Jenny Toomey, backed by theThe Pine Valley Cosmonauts in 2002; Clare Teal in 2003; Labelle and Patricia Barber in 2008; Rosemary Clooney, Lonnie Donegan, Billie Holiday, Richard Manuel, Carmen McRae, Bette Midler, The Mills Brothers, Joan Morris, Rufus Wainwright, Josh White, and many others.\nQuestion:\n\"Born 1892, who composed the song \"\"Miss Otis Regrets\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nCole Porter\nPassage:\nTian Tian (male giant panda)\nTian Tian () is a 275-pound male giant panda at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. The panda was born on August 27, 1997, at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda at the Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan Province, to Yong Ba (mother) and Pan Pan (father). Tian Tian is the half-brother of the San Diego Zoo's Bai Yun.\n\nGiant pandas are thought to be solitary creatures, except for mating season and mothers with young cubs.  In keeping with the habits of wild pandas, Tian is generally alone, although the zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, and Tian are occasionally together outside of breeding season.  While Tai Shan was still at the National Zoo, Tian and Tai occasionally viewed each other through a mesh-opening in the fence and were aware of each other's presence through scent marking. Male Giant Pandas play no part in raising their young in the wild. Tian and Mei are trained to participate in a full medical examination, including a blood draw, without anesthesia. \n\nFatherhood\n\nTian Tian is a  father by artificial insemination only. While he and Mei Xang have been given multiple opportunities to mate naturally--and both are interested in doing so--they have never gotten the positioning correct. This is a  problem with giant pandas born in captivity. In the summer of 2005, Mei gave birth to a male cub, Tai Shan, on July 9, 2005.[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GiantPandas/default.cfm Giant Pandas - National Zoo| FONZ]  In keeping with the agreement made at the time Tian Tian and Mei Xiang arrived in the United States, Tai Shan left the National Zoo in February 2010 to return to his ancestral homeland. He flew to China on the same flight as his cousin Mei Lan, who was born at Zoo Atlanta.\n\nSome of Tian Tian's semen was preserved cryogenically, and used when Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated in 2012.  Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub on the night of September 16, 2012.  The unnamed cub died of liver failure at a week old.\n\nOn August 23, 2013, at 5:30pm, Mei Xiang delivered a female cub who was later named Bao Bao. Her name was selected by the public and given on her 100th day of life. Approximately 23 hours after Bao Bao's birth, Mei Xiang delivered a second cub, also female, who was stillborn. Bao Bao lives at the National Zoo, and will be sent to China when she is four years old.\n\nTian Tian has been confirmed through genetic testing to be the father of two cubs, both male, born to Mei Xiang on August 22, 2015. One of the cubs was named Bei Bei by the respective wives of the American and Chinese presidents. The second cub died at 4 days old and was not named.\nQuestion:\nTian Tian and Yang Guang are?\nAnswer:\nPanda bear (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nLincoln Imp\nThe Lincoln Imp is a grotesque on a wall inside Lincoln Cathedral, England, and it has become the symbol of the city of Lincoln. A legend tells of it being a creature sent to the cathedral by Satan, only to be turned into stone by an angel.\n\nLegends\n\nAccording to a 14th-century legend, two mischievous creatures called imps were sent by Satan to do evil work on Earth. After causing mayhem in Northern England, the two imps headed to Lincoln Cathedral, where they smashed tables and chairs and tripped up the Bishop. When an angel came out of a book of hymns and told them to stop, one of the imps was brave and started throwing rocks at the angel, but the other imp cowered under the broken tables and chairs. The angel turned the first imp to stone, giving the second imp a chance to escape.  It is said that even on still days it is always windy around the cathedral, which is the second imp circling the building looking for his friend.  \n\nThere are many variations on Lincoln Imp legends. According to one popular legend, the imp which escaped fled north to Grimsby, where it soon began making trouble. It entered  St. James' Church and began repeating its behaviour from Lincoln Cathedral. The angel reappeared and gave the imp's backside a good thrashing before turning it to stone as it had the first imp at Lincoln. The \"Grimsby Imp\" can still be seen in St James' Church, clinging to its sore bottom. Another legend has the escaped imp turned to stone just outside the cathedral, and sharp-eyed visitors can spot it on a South outside wall.  \n\nLincoln College, Oxford \n\nAn 1899 reproduction of the Lincoln Imp also overlooked the Front Quad of Lincoln College, Oxford until 2000 when it was transferred to the bar (Deep Hall) and another Imp was erected in the traditional position above the entrance to Hall. This has given rise to a traditional Oxford expression: 'to look on someone like the Imp looks over Lincoln' as well as giving rise to the title of the college's undergraduate newspaper: The Lincoln Imp. The Lincoln Imp is also the mascot of the college boat club, an image of which is used to decorate the oars and jerseys of the men's 1st VIII.  \n\nWider use of the image \n\nThe use of the figure is extremely widespread across both England and Scotland. It is hard to imagine that each image was aware of the Lincoln example. It must therefore be speculated that the form is a widespread image predating its use at Lincoln, and simply an everyday deity in the same mode as the \"Green Man\". In the 18th century it was a fairly popular door-knocker design.\n\nThe critical features of the form are: cloven feet; one leg raised so the foot rests on the other knee; both hands holding the raised leg; open mouth with sharp teeth; cow ears; hairy body. \n\nThe Lincoln example is by far the best-known (and most public) example, hence the normal term \"Lincoln Imp\". Whilst most examples predate 1800 the term itself only seems to have become widespread at the end of the 19th century, presumably due to contemporary publicity regarding the cathedral's imp.\n\nLincoln City Football Club are nicknamed \"The Imps,\" and an image of the Lincoln Imp appears on their crest. Also, the club's mascot is called Poacher the Imp.  Lincoln Hockey Club are also known by this name, and the image of the Lincoln Imp appears on their crest. The Lincoln Imp is the badge of No. LXI Squadron RAF. \n\nJames Usher\n\nJames Ward Usher, local businessman and philanthropist, obtained sole rights to use the image of the Lincoln Imp in jewellry, in the late 19th century.  This seems to have contributed a great deal to his fame and wealth.\nQuestion:\nThe imp is the symbol of which English city?\nAnswer:\nLincoln (Amtrak station)\nPassage:\nFifth planet (hypothetical)\nIn the history of astronomy, a handful of Solar System bodies have been counted as the fifth planet from the Sun. Under the present definition of a planet, Jupiter is counted as the fifth.\n\nHypotheses \n\nThere are three main ideas regarding hypothetical planets between Mars and Jupiter.\n\nAsteroids \n\nDuring the early 19th century, as asteroids were discovered, they were considered planets. Jupiter became the sixth planet with the discovery of Ceres in 1801. Soon, three more asteroids, Pallas (1802), Juno (1804), and Vesta (1807) were discovered. They were counted as separate planets, despite the fact that they shared an orbit as defined by the Titius–Bode law. Between 1845 and 1851, eleven additional asteroids were discovered and Jupiter had become the twentieth planet. At this point, astronomers began to classify asteroids as minor planets.  Following the reclassification of the asteroids in their own group, Jupiter became the fifth planet once again. With the redefinition of the term planet in 2006, Ceres is now considered a dwarf planet.\n\nThe Disruption Theory \n\nA hypothetical planet between Mars and Jupiter has long been thought to have occupied the space where the asteroid belt is currently located. Scientists in the 20th century dubbed this hypothetical planet Phaeton. Today, the Phaeton hypothesis, superseded by the accretion model, has been discarded by the scientific community; however, some fringe scientists regard this theory as credible and even likely.\n\nThe Planet V Theory \n\nBased on simulations, NASA space scientists John Chambers and Jack Lissauer have proposed the existence of a planet between Mars and the asteroid belt, going in a successively eccentric and unstable orbit, 4 billion years ago. They connect this planet, which they name Planet V, and its disappearance with the Late Heavy Bombardment episode of the Hadean era.   Chambers and Lissauer also claim this Planet V most probably ended up crashing into the Sun. Unlike the Disruption Theory's fifth planet, \"Planet V\" is not credited with creating the asteroid belt.\n\nFifth planet in fiction \n\nThe concept of a fifth planet which had been destroyed to make the asteroid belt, as in the Disruption Theory, has been a popular one in fiction.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the fifth planet from the sun?\nAnswer:\nPhysical characteristics of Jupiter\nPassage:\nJeans Revolution\nThe Jeans Revolution (, transliteration: Džynsavaja revalucyja, ) was a term used by Belarus' democratic opposition to describe their protests following the 2006 Belarusian presidential election. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe Jeans Revolution was also referred to as the Cornflower Revolution (васильковая революция, in Russian media) and the Denim Revolution, in reference to the color blue as a parallel to the other color revolutions; however, unlike them, the Jeans Revolution did not bring radical changes to Belarusian politics and society.\n\nHistory\n\nThe term was coined after a September 16, 2005 public demonstration against the policies of Alexander Lukashenko. On September 16, 1999, popular opposition leader  Viktor Gonchar disappeared; the present head of SOBR, Dmitri Pavlichenko, is suspected by the Council of Europe to be linked to Gonchar's disappearance.  The Belarusian police seized the  white-red-white flags used by the opposition and banned in the state, and an activist of the youth movement Zubr, Mikita Sasim (Belarusian: Мiкiта Сасiм, Russian: Никита Сасим), raised his denim shirt (commonly called \"jeans shirt\" in Russian), announcing this will be their flag instead.  This spontaneous incident was recognized to have a symbolic meaning. In the former  Soviet Union jeans were a symbol of the Western culture, and hence jeans were immediately recognized by Belarusian opposition as a symbol of protest against Lukashenko's Soviet-like policies, as well as the symbol that Belarusians are \"not isolated\" (from  the West)  Subsequently, Zubr suggested to wear jeans on 16th day of each month, in remembrance of alleged disappearances in Belarus. \n\nThe term \"Jeans Revolution\" was brought to worldwide attention in reference to the demonstrations held in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, disputing the elections. Up to 40,000 protesters gathered in October Square on March 19, 2006, it is believed.\n\nThe protest against the outcome of the March 19 election began as soon as polls closed late Sunday, with more than 10,000 people gathering in the square. The protest dwindled since then. Each evening saw a smaller and smaller gathering—5,000 on Monday, 3,000 to 4,000 on Tuesday. As of March 23, only about 200 mostly youthful protesters remained concentrated around the opposition's tent camp erected on October Square in Minsk. [http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060323/ts_afp/belarusvote_060323111428]\n\nOn March 24, authorities sent in riot police to clear out the makeshift tent camp in October Square and told them to disperse. State television emphasized a report from city police stating that no one was hurt in the operation. Some observers said the relatively gentle treatment of demonstrators suggested that Belarusian president may be attempting to react more sensitively given Western opinion. [http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060324/ts_nm/belarus_dc_50]\n\nPresident Alexander Lukashenko earlier announced that protests similar to what occurred during the Orange, Rose, and Tulip Revolutions will not take place in Belarus, stating that \"force will not be used\" to claim the presidency. Belarus authorities vowed to crush unrest in the event of large-scale protests following the election. Despite the government's prediction, the rally after the election was the biggest the opposition had mustered in years, reaching at least 10,000, according to AP reporters' estimates.\n\nOn March 20, Alaksandar Milinkievič told to 7,000 supporters (smaller than Sunday's gathering) that they faced a long haul with their protests: \"We, free people of Belarus, will never recognise the election. They are afraid of us. Their power is based on lies\". However, Lukashenko renewed charges that his rivals had planned pro-Western revolts like those in ex-Soviet  Ukraine and Georgia.  \"Let me say that the revolution that so many people talked about and some were preparing, has failed and it could not be otherwise\", he stated during the news conference on his victory.\n\nOn March 25, the 45,000 protesters in Belarus met police that did not clash with them, because they were waiting for riot police, but they did not interfere. However, moving on, the protesters clashed with riot police and were eventually driven back. The riot police arrested more than 100 people along with Alexander Kozulin, a supporter of the protests and a candidate against Lukashenko. Kozulin was allegedly assaulted by the police during his arrest   and on July 14, 2006, was sentenced to five-and-a-half years imprisonment for his actions in the protests. \n\nAlso on the 25, Milinkievič stated that he hoped for a monthlong cease in protests, apparently hoping that he could build up opposition and calm angst.\n\nThe opposition movement, especially the post-election protests, was documented by Belarusian filmmaker Yury Khashchavatski in his film Kalinoŭvski Square.\nQuestion:\nIn which East European country did the 2006 Jeans revolution take place?\nAnswer:\nVitryssland\nPassage:\nTincture\nA tincture is typically an alcoholic extract of plant or animal material or solution of such, or of a low volatility substance (such as iodine and mercurochrome). To qualify as an alcoholic tincture, the extract should have an ethanol percentage of at least 25–60% (50–120 US proof). Sometimes an alcohol concentration as high as 90% (180 US proof) is used in such a tincture.  In herbal medicine, alcoholic tinctures are made with various  ethanol concentrations, 25% being the most common.\n\nHerbal tinctures are not always made using ethanol as the solvent, though this is most commonly the case. Other solvents include vinegar, glycerol, diethyl ether and propylene glycol, not all of which can be used for internal consumption. Ethanol has the advantage of being an excellent solvent for both acidic and basic (alkaline) constituents.Glycerine can also be used, but when used in tincturing fashion is generally a poorer solvent. Vinegar, being acidic, is a better solvent for obtaining alkaloids but a poorer solvent for acidic components. For individuals who choose not to ingest alcohol, non-alcoholic e,g., (glycerite) extracts offer an alternative for preparations meant to be taken internally.\n\nSome solutions of volatile or nonvolatile substances are traditionally called spirits, regardless of whether obtained by distillation or not and whether or not they even contain alcohol.\nIn chemistry, a tincture is a solution that has alcohol as its solvent.\n\nMethod of preparation\n\n*Herbs are put in a container and a spirit of 40% or more ethanol is added, for example, 80 proof vodka or 190 proof rectified spirit (such as Everclear).\n*The jar is left to stand for 2–3 weeks and shaken occasionally in order to maximize extraction.\n\nMore accurate measuring can be done by combining 1 part herbs with a water-ethanol mixture of 2–10 parts, depending on the herb itself. For most tinctures, however, 1 part water to 5 parts ethanol is typical.\n\nExamples\n\nSome examples that were formerly common in medicine  include:\n* Tincture of Benzoin\n* Tincture of cannabis\n* Tincture of cantharides\n* Tincture of Castoreum\n* Tincture of ferric citrochloride, a chelate of citric acid and Iron(III) chloride\n* Tincture of green soap, which classically contains lavender oil\n* Tincture of guaiac gum\n* Tincture of iodine\n* Tincture of opium, (laudanum)\n* Camphorated opium tincture (paregoric)\n* Tincture of Pennyroyal\n* Warburg's Tincture, (\"Tinctura Antiperiodica\" or \"Antiperiodic Tincture\", a 19th-century antipyretic)\n\nExamples of spirits include:\n* Spirit of ammonia (spirits of hartshorn)\n* Spirit of camphor\n* Spirit of ether, a solution of diethyl ether in alcohol\n* \"Spirit of Mindererus\", ammonium acetate in alcohol\n* \"Spirit of nitre\" is not a spirit in this sense, but an old name for nitric acid (but \"sweet spirit of nitre\" was ethyl nitrite)\n* Similarly \"spirit(s) of salt\" actually meant hydrochloric acid. The concentrated, fuming, 35% acid is still sold under this name in the UK, for use as a drain-cleaning fluid.\n* \"Spirit of vinegar\" is an antiquated term for glacial acetic acid\n* \"Spirit of vitriol\" is an antiquated term for sulfuric acid\n* \"Spirit of wine\" or \"spirits of wine\" is an old term for alcohol (especially food grade alcohol derived from the distillation of wine)\n* \"Spirit of wood\" referred to methanol, often derived from the destructive distillation of wood\n\nAdvantages\n\nEthanol is able to dissolve substances which are less soluble in water, while at the same time the water content can dissolve the substances less soluble in ethanol. One can sometimes vary the proportion of ethanol and water to produce tinctures with different characteristics due to the distinct solvent properties of these two. Tincture of calendula is commonly tinctured at either 25% or 90% ethanol. The alcohol content also acts as a preservative.It is widely employed as solvent for extraction.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nEthanol has a tendency to denature some organic compounds, rendering them so changed as to be ineffective. This is one reason why ethanol is an antimicrobial. This tendency can also have undesirable effects when extracting botanical constituents, for instance, polysaccharides. Certain other constituents, common among them proteins, can become irreversibly denatured, or \"pickled\" in a manner of speaking. Also, extracted for highly complex aromatic components are denatured by alcohol's intrinsic cleaving action upon an aromatic's complex structure into simpler inert-rendered compounds. A basic tenet of organic chemistry teaches that any time a biologically viable component is denatured, it will reduce or negate its prior biological viability. This fact must be considered by the clinician and/or consumer from both the standpoint of efficacy and dosage when choosing ethanol-based botanical tinctures.\n\nEther and propylene glycol based tinctures are not suitable for internal consumption, although they are used in preparations for external use, such as personal care cremes and ointments.\nQuestion:\nIn medicine, how was a tincture of opium known?\nAnswer:\nOpium tincture\nPassage:\n9780140139648: Macca Can! - AbeBooks - McMahon, Steve ...\n9780140139648: Macca Can! - AbeBooks - McMahon, Steve; Harris, Harry: 0140139648\nMcMahon, Steve; Harris, Harry\nISBN 10: 0140139648 ISBN 13: 9780140139648\nPublisher: Penguin Books Ltd, 1991\nSynopsis\nSteve McMahon's autobiography is an account of his football career and personal life.

Bookseller Inventory # 7719-9780140139648\nQuestion:\nThe book Macca Can was about which ex-Liverpool footballer?\nAnswer:\nStephen McMahon\nPassage:\nJohn Lloyd (tennis)\nJohn Lloyd (born 27 August 1954) is a former professional tennis player who reached an ATP world ranking of 21 from 23 July 1978 to 30 July 1978 and who was ranked as UK number 1 in 1984 and 1985.  He now works as sports commentator.\n\nDuring his career, he reached one Grand Slam singles final and won three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles with tennis partner Wendy Turnbull, the French Open in 1982 and Wimbledon in 1983 and 1984. Also, Lloyd scored 27 wins and 24 losses with the Great Britain Davis Cup team.\n\nHe was the first husband of the former top woman player Chris Evert and is the younger brother of the former British Davis Cup captain David Lloyd. \nHe served as the British Davis Cup Captain Himself from August 2006 – March 2010. \nHe is a Member of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.\n\nEducation\n\nLloyd was educated at Southend High School for Boys, a state grammar school in Southend-on-Sea in Essex, in South East England. \n\nLife and career\n\nAt the Australian Open in December 1977, Lloyd became the first British male tennis player in the Open era to reach a Grand Slam singles final. He lost in five sets to America's Vitas Gerulaitis 6–3, 7–6, 5–7, 3–6, 6–2. No other British player reached a Grand Slam final for 20 years, until British-Canadian Greg Rusedski reached the US Open final in 1997. In 1984 he reached the quarter-finals of the US Open. Lloyd never progressed beyond the third round in singles play at Wimbledon.\n\nThough he never won a Grand Slam singles titles, Lloyd did win three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles partnering Australia's Wendy Turnbull, beginning with the French Open mixed doubles in 1982. The pair finished runners-up in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon that year, and then went on to win the Wimbledon mixed doubles crown in both 1983 and 1984.\n\nLloyd's career-high singles ranking was World No. 21 in 1978. He was a member of the British team that reached the final of the Davis Cup that year with Lloyd himself losing in straight sets in the singles to Brian Gottfried and to a 19-year-old John McEnroe.  As a player, he represented the British Davis Cup team for 11 years.\nHis career-high doubles ranking was World No. 34 in 1986.\nAs his playing career came to an end, Lloyd stayed within the tennis world, finding work as a coach and television commentator, and appearing on the veterans circuit.\n\nIn 2006, Lloyd was appointed the captain of Great Britain's Davis Cup team, replacing Jeremy Bates.  Lloyd's reign started very well, with successive victories taking the team back into the World Group, but after the retirement of both Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman in 2007 the team suffered five successive defeats, their worst run in Davis Cup history, to drop back down to the third tier of the competition. Lloyd resigned as coach in mid-2010. \n\nCommentator\n\nSince the 1990s, Lloyd has been a commentator and analyst for the BBC's tennis coverage, particularly at Wimbledon. Lloyd is known for his trademark catchphrases, using the analogy of food and drink to describe tennis shots. For example, if a shot is too weak he will claim that it was \"undercooked\" or \"needed more mustard.\" Conversely, if a shot is overhit he will describe it as \"overcooked\", having \"too much juice\", or \"having too much mustard.\"\n\nHe worked for Sky Sports on their coverage of the US Open 2009.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1979, Lloyd married the World No. 1 woman player, American Chris Evert (who became Chris Evert-Lloyd). The media-styled \"golden couple\" of tennis enjoyed several years in the limelight before a separation, a short-lived reconciliation, and eventual divorce in 1987. Because of Evert's higher profile tennis career, Lloyd was sometimes jokingly referred to in the press as \"Mr. Evert\". \n\nLloyd is a supporter of the football team Wolverhampton Wanderers. It is because of Lloyd's influence that Andy Murray is also a Wolves fan and is often seen wearing the Wolves shirt that was presented to him by Lloyd. \n\nGrand Slam finals\n\nSingles : 1 (1 runner-up)\n\nMixed doubles (4)\n\nWins (3)\n\nRunners-up (1)\n\nGrand Prix Championship Series singles finals \n\nRunner-up (1)\n\nOther career titles\n\nSingles (1)\n\nDoubles (2)\n\nReferences and notes\nQuestion:\nWhich Australian tennis player twice partnered Britain’s John Lloyd to win the mixed doubles at Wimbledon/\nAnswer:\nWendy Turnbull\nPassage:\nPoll: Best Long Running British TV Comedy - IMDb\nPoll: Best Long Running British TV Comedy - IMDb - IMDb\nPoll: Best Long Running British TV Comedy\nA poll by cartman_1337 .\nWhich of these UK TV comedy shows* that lasted at least 4 series is the funniest?\n*Scripted mainly comedy shows, no talk shows, game shows or shows where the comedy part was secondary/incidental, and only entirely UK productions.

It needs daily exercise and daily interaction, and a lot of both. It loves the chance to herd, but its requirements can also be met with a good jog, a very long walk or a vigorous play session. It can live outdoors in temperate to cool climates. It makes a good house dog, however, and would prefer access to both house and yard. Its harsh coat needs combing once or twice weekly, plus scissoring and shaping (clipping for pets and stripping for show dogs) every three months.\n Major concerns: CHD\nWatch Video\nThe bouvier des Flandres served farmers and cattle merchants in controlling cattle in the great farmlands of southwest Flanders and on the French northern plain. In fact, bouvier means \"cowherd\" or \"oxherd\" in French, although the dogs were formerly more often called vuilbaard (dirty beard) or koe hond (cow dog). Besides its main duty as a cattle drover, the bouvier was an all-around farm dog, functioning also as a livestock and farm guard and draft dog. As expected from a dog selected to perform a variety of tasks, these working dogs were of a variety of types, colors and even sizes. This wide variety also reflected the fact that this was a working dog, and breeding stock was chosen by ability, not pedigree or esthetics. The derivation of the breed is not documented but may have included mastiff, sheepdog and possibly even spaniel breeds. The first breed standard, drawn up in 1912, reflected this diversity of types and signaled a growing interest in the breed from dog fanciers. In the midst of the breed's rising popularity, most of the bouviers were lost in World War I  although some served as ambulance and messenger dogs during the war. One of the few survivors was of such superior quality that the breed was successfully revived through his progeny. This dog, Ch. Nic de Sottegem, can be found in virtually every modern bouvier pedigree. In 1922, a revised standard further defined the desirable bouvier type, and helped pave the way to a more homogeneous breed. When the first bouviers entered American show rings in the 1930s, they aroused much attention among dog fanciers. The breed has never become extremely popular, but it is well-known at dog shows and herding trials.\nQuestion:\nA Bouvier is what type of animal?\nAnswer:\nDomestic dogs\nPassage:\nThe Country of the Blind\n\"The Country of the Blind\" is a short story written by H. G. Wells. It was first published in the April 1904 issue of The Strand Magazine and included in a 1911 collection of Wells's short stories, The Country of the Blind and Other Stories. It is one of Wells's best known short stories, and features prominently in literature dealing with blindness.\n\nWells later revised the story, with the expanded version first published by an English private printer, Golden Cockerel Press, in 1939.\n\nPlot summary\n\nWhile attempting to summit the unconquered crest of Parascotopetl (a fictitious mountain in Ecuador), a mountaineer named Nuñez (prn: noon-yes) slips and falls down the far side of the mountain. At the end of his descent, down a snow-slope in the mountain's shadow, he finds a valley, cut off from the rest of the world on all sides by steep precipices. Unbeknownst to Nuñez, he has discovered the fabled \"Country of the Blind\". The valley had been a haven for settlers fleeing the tyranny of Spanish rulers, until an earthquake reshaped the surrounding mountains, cutting the valley off forever from future explorers. The isolated community prospered over the years, despite a disease that struck them early on, rendering all newborns blind. As the blindness slowly spreads over many generations, the people's remaining senses sharpened, and by the time the last sighted villager had died, the community had fully adapted to life without sight.\n\nNuñez descends into the valley and finds an unusual village with windowless houses and a network of paths, all bordered by curbs. Upon discovering that everyone is blind, Nuñez begins reciting to himself the refrain, \"In the Country of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man is King\". He realises that he can teach and rule them, but the villagers have no concept of sight, and do not understand his attempts to explain this fifth sense to them. Frustrated, Nuñez becomes angry, but the villagers calm him, and he reluctantly submits to their way of life, because returning to the outside world seems impossible.\n\nNuñez is assigned to work for a villager named Yacob. He becomes attracted to Yacob's youngest daughter, Medina-Saroté. Nuñez and Medina-Saroté soon fall in love with one another, and having won her confidence, Nuñez slowly starts trying to explain sight to her. Medina-Saroté, however, simply dismisses it as his imagination. When Nuñez asks for her hand in marriage, he is turned down by the village elders on account of his \"unstable\" obsession with \"sight\". The village doctor suggests that Nuñez's eyes be removed, claiming that they are diseased and are affecting his brain. Nuñez reluctantly consents to the operation because of his love for Medina-Saroté. However, at sunrise on the day of the operation, while all the villagers are asleep, Nuñez, the failed King of the Blind, sets off for the mountains (without provisions or equipment), hoping to find a passage to the outside world, and escape the valley.\n\nIn the original story, Nuñez climbs high into the surrounding mountains until night falls, and he rests, weak with cuts and bruises, but happy that he has escaped the valley. His fate is not revealed. In the revised and expanded 1939 version of the story, Nuñez sees from a distance that there is about to be a rock slide. He attempts to warn the villagers, but again they scoff at his \"imagined\" sight. He flees the valley during the slide, taking Medina-Saroté with him.\n\nCharacters\n\n*Nuñez – a mountaineer from Bogotá, Colombia\n*Yacob – Nuñez's master\n*Medina-Saroté – the youngest daughter of Yacob\n\nAdaptations\n\n*Several radio adaptations of the story have been produced. Escape aired debuted its adaptation starring Raymond Burr Thanksgiving week, 1947, which featured a different ending in which Nuñez escapes the Valley alone (and thus is able to tell the story in-character), but goes blind in the process due to the constant glare from the snow. Another episode of Escape aired 6/27/1948, starring Paul Frees. In 1954, 1957 and 1959 the CBS radio series Suspense rebroadcast this version. CBS Radio Mystery Theater aired another radio adaptation May 7, 1979. The episode was titled \"Search for Eden\" (episode 977) and the main characters' names were changed—Nunez was renamed Carlos and Medina-Saroté was renamed Eva. The BBC folded the story in two others by Wells for a BBC Radio 4 Extra entitled \"The Door in the Wall\", also with a twist at the end in which the storyteller reveals himself to be the tale's protagonist. \n*A teleplay written by Frank Gabrielsen was produced in 1962 for the TV series The DuPont Show of the Week. The title of the hour-long episode was \"The Richest Man in Bogota\", and it aired on 17 June 1962.  It starred Lee Marvin as Juan de Nuñez, and Míriam Colón as \"Marina\" (not Medina-Saroté, as in the original story).\n*The Russian studio Soyuzmultfilm made a wordless 19-minute animated film adaptation in 1995 called Land of Blind (Страна Слепых). \n*The composer Mark-Anthony Turnage wrote a chamber opera based on the story, completed in 1997.\n*A stage production was written by Frank Higgins; the only production to date has been in The Coterie Theater in Kansas City, Missouri in 2006.\nQuestion:\n\"Who said \"\"In the Country of the Blind The One-eyed Man is King?\"\nAnswer:\nHerbet wells\nPassage:\nWillie John McBride\nWilliam James McBride, MBE, better known as Willie John McBride (born 6 June 1940) is a former rugby union footballer who played as a lock for Ireland and the British and Irish Lions. He played 63 Tests for Ireland including eleven as captain, and toured with the Lions five times — a record that gave him 17 Lions Test caps. He also captained the most successful ever Lions side which toured South Africa in 1974.\n\nYouth\n\nMcBride was born at Toomebridge, County Antrim.  Owing to his father's death when he was five years old, he spent most of his spare time helping out on his family farm.  Because of this he did not start playing rugby until he was 17. He was educated at Ballymena Academy and played for the school's First XV. After he left he joined \nBallymena R.F.C..\n\nPlaying career\n\nIn 1962 was selected to play for Ireland. His  first Test on 10 February 1962 was against England at Twickenham. Later that year he was selected to tour South Africa with the British and Irish Lions.\n\nMcBride continued to play for Ireland throughout the 1960s and played for Ireland when they first defeated South Africa (the Springboks) in 1965, and when Ireland defeated Australia in Sydney — the first time a Home Nations team had defeated a major southern hemisphere team in their own country. He was again selected for the Lions in 1966, this time touring New Zealand and Australia. He toured South Africa with the Lions again in 1968.\n\nHe was selected to play for the Lions in their 1971 tour of New Zealand. Despite being criticized by some as being \"over the hill\", McBride was made pack leader and helped the Lions to a Test series win over New Zealand; their first and last series win over New Zealand. He received an MBE in 1971 for services to rugby football.\n\n1974 Lions tour to South Africa\n\nMcBride's outstanding leadership qualities led to his appointment as captain of the British and Irish Lions in their 1974 tour to South Africa. The Test series was won 3-0, with one match drawn — the first Lions series ever won in South Africa. It was one of the most controversial and physical Test match series ever played. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, and so decided to match fire with fire.  Willie John McBride instigated a policy of \"one in, all in\" - that is, when one Lion retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest Springbok. \n\nAt that time there were only substitutions if a doctor agreed that a player was physically unable to continue and there were no video cameras and sideline officials to keep the punching, kicking, and head butting to a minimum. If the South Africans were to resort to foul play then the Lions decided \"to get their retaliation in first.\" The signal for this was to call \"99\" (a shortened version of the emergency number in the United Kingdom — 999). This was a signal for the Lions to clobber their nearest rival players.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn 1975 as his international career was ending he played his last game for Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The game was against France and near the end of the match, he scored his first Test try for Ireland. It was the crowning moment of a great playing career. His last international game was against Wales on Saturday 15 March 1975.  \n\nAfter retiring from playing the game, McBride coached the Irish team and was manager of the 1983 Lions tour to New Zealand. Despite the test results being mainly poor, team camaraderie was high and some good wins were recorded in other games. In 1997 he was an inaugural inductee into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. He lives in Ballyclare. He has been asked to present Test jerseys and give motivational speeches to Lions players prior to matches. In 2004 he was named in Rugby World magazine as \"Rugby Personality of the Century\". He is a major supporter of the Wooden Spoon Society. \n\nHe is remembered by members and supporters of Stockport Rugby Club for attending the Glengarth Sevens with a lion cub from Longleat, helping to raise money for the charity and adding to the atmosphere and help upkeep the reputation of sevens rugby at Stockport.\nQuestion:\nWillie John McBride is a name associated with which sport?\nAnswer:\nRugby union footballer\n\n\nPassage:\nSarah Palin's Confused About Where The White House Is ...\nSarah Palin's Confused About Where The White House Is - ABC News\nABC News\nSarah Palin's Confused About Where The White House Is\nSep 26, 2014, 5:29 PM ET\nVIDEO: Sarah Palin Says White House Located at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue\nABCNews.com\nCopy\nAlthough 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue may be the most famous address in the country, that doesn't mean everyone remembers it.\nAt the Value Voters Summit today in Washington, D.C, former Alaska Gov.

An umbrella is very thin and narrow when it is down, so it can fit through the narrow opening of a chimney. When an umbrella is up, however, it is too large to fit through the same narrow opening.\nQuestion:\nWhat can go up a chimney down, but not down a chimney up?\nAnswer:\nAn umbrella\nPassage:\nGrounation Day\nGrounation Day (April 21) is an important Rastafari holy day, and second after Coronation Day (November 2). It is celebrated in honor of Haile Selassie's 1966 visit to Jamaica.\n\nVisit of Selassie to Jamaica\n\nHaile  Selassie had already met with several Rasta elders in Addis Ababa, and had allowed Rastafari and other people of African descent to settle on his personal land in Shashamane.\n\nHaile Selassie visited Jamaica on Thursday, 21 April 1966. Some 100,000 Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston,  having heard that the man whom they considered to be God was coming to visit them. They waited at the airport playing drums and smoking large quantities of marijuana. Today the Rastafari celebrate that Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on April 21st.\n\nWhen Haile Selassie's Ethiopian Airlines flight landed at the airport at 1:30 PM, the crowd surrounded his plane on the tarmac. The day had been overcast and stormy. After about half an hour, the door swung open and the emperor appeared at the top of the mobile steps. A deafening tumult was heard from the crowd, who beat calabash drums, lit firecrackers, waved signs, and sounded Abeng horns of the Maroons.  All protocol was dropped as the crowd pressed past the security forces and onto the red carpet that had been laid out for the reception. Selassie waved from the top of the steps; some interpreters have claimed that he shed tears, although this is disputed. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor's descent.  When Planno reemerged, he announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\"  After Planno escorted the African monarch down the steps, journalists were puzzled by Selassie's refusal to walk on the red carpet on the way to his limousine. [hence grounation, Iyaric equivalent of foundation, \"uplifted\" with the sound of the word ground in the sense of \"making contact with the soil\"]  He was then driven to the King's House, the residence of Governor-General Clifford Campbell.  \n\nAs a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions  attended by His Majesty,   and Rastafari elders, including Planno and probably Joseph Hibbert, also obtained a private audience with the Emperor,  where he reportedly told them that they should not immigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as \"liberation before repatriation\". At a dinner held at the King's House, Rastas claimed that acting Jamaican Prime Minister Donald Sangster had stamped his foot at Lulu, Haile Selassie's pet chihuahua, who, they swore, had responded with the roar of a lion. \n\nDefying expectations of the Jamaican authorities,  Selassie never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as the Messiah. Instead, he presented the movement's faithful elders with gold medallions bearing the Ethiopian seal – the only recipients of such an honour on this visit.  Meanwhile, he presented some of the Jamaican politicians, including Sangster, with miniature coffin-shaped cigarette boxes.\n\nImpact \n\nRita Marley, Bob Marley's wife, converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie in his motorcade en route to the King's House.  She claimed, in interviews and in her book No Woman No Cry, that she had seen a stigma on Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd, and was instantly convinced of his divinity.   \n\nFor years afterward, Planno, who became a spiritual guru of Bob Marley, would give out enlarged photographs of himself with the Emperor on the steps of the airplane.  \n\nThe great significance of this event in the development of the Rastafari religion should not be underestimated. Having been outcasts in society, they gained a measure of respectability for the first time.    By making Rasta more acceptable, it opened the way for the commercialisation of reggae, leading in turn to the further global spread of Rastafari.\n\nHaile Selassie is thought to have encouraged the Rastafari elders to learn about the Ethiopian Orthodox faith while in Jamaica, and in 1970, he dispatched Archbishop Laike Mandefro to establish a mission in Jamaica. Mandefro was formally invited by Joseph Hibbert, one of the original founders of the Rastafari Movement, to teach the Rasta community, and in 1971 Mandefro named Hibbert as a \"Spiritual Organizer\".  During this time, Mandefro pointedly refused calls to demand that the Rastafari renounce their faith in Haile Selassie's divinity, and some 2,000 Rastas accordingly received Orthodox baptisms. \n\nBecause of Haile Selassie's visit, April 21 is celebrated as Grounation Day. The \"Abu Ye! Abu Ye Abu ye! Abu ye!\" chant is an element of Grounation Day festivities.\nQuestion:\nGrounation Day (April 21) and Coronation Day (November 2) are important holy days in which religion?\nAnswer:\nListing of noted rastafarians\nPassage:\nBBC Sports Personality of the Year - BBC News\nBBC SPORT | TV/Radio Schedule | Sports Personality | Hoy named BBC Sports Personality\nHoy wins Sports Personality of the Year\nOlympic cycling champion Chris Hoy has been named 2008 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\nThe Scot, who won three gold medals in Beijing, beat Lewis Hamilton and Rebecca Adlington to the honour.\nHoy, 32, becomes the first cyclist to win the prestigious award since Tommy Simpson in 1965.\n\"To win this award this year is so special as British sport has enjoyed such a hugely successful year.

She became well known for her strong cockney accent and frequent use of cockney slang, and found fame through a series of television adverts for Campari before embarking on an acting career. She is best known for playing the role of Steph Forsythe in ITV soap opera Emmerdale from 2002 to 2006.\n\nTelevision\n\nAfter initially working as a model, Chase came to public attention in the mid 1970s when she began appearing in television adverts for Campari. The comical adverts were filmed in exotic locations with Chase having drinks with an elegant, sophisticated gentleman suitor played by Jeremy Clyde. Upon his romantic question \"Were you truly wafted here from paradise?\", Chase would declare in her full cockney accent \"Nah, Luton Airport!\"  The line became something of a catchphrase and inspired the 1979 hit record \"Luton Airport\" by Cats U.K.  Contrary to public belief, Chase was not involved with the record in any way, though she did make a novelty record of her own in 1979, entitled \"It's Nice 'Ere, Innit\" (also based on a line from another one of her Campari ads). However, this was unsuccessful. In 2009, the Campari ad featuring Chase was placed 41st in Channel 4's 100 Greatest TV Adverts. \n\nFrom 1979, Chase was a recurring guest on the BBC quiz show Blankety Blank, hosted by Terry Wogan and later on Les Dawson.\n\nIn 1980, she appeared in the ITV children's television programme Worzel Gummidge, as the character Dolly Clothes-Peg. Dolly tried to woo the hapless scarecrow Worzel, played by Jon Pertwee, but he spurned her in favour of his unrequited love affair with Aunt Sally, played by Una Stubbs.\n\nThe same year, Chase began her most prominent role in the ITV sitcom The Other 'Arf, in which she co-starred with John Standing. The Other 'Arf ran for four series until 1984, after which Chase appeared in the less successful 1984 TV sitcom Lame Ducks.\n\nFollowing this, Chase made sporadic appearances on television as herself on light entertainment series such as The Bob Monkhouse Show and Surprise, Surprise, though she did not continue her television acting career until the late 1990s when she appeared in episodes of Casualty and The Bill. In 2000, she had a recurring role in the TV series Lock, Stock... (based on the 1998 feature film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels).\n\nIn 2002, Chase joined the cast of the long-running ITV soap opera Emmerdale, playing Steph Forsythe. Executive producer Steve Frost chose her to play the mother of Sheree Murphy's character Tricia Stokes due their physical resemblance. She played an ex-convict and featured in some of the shows most prominent controversial storylines to date including family bereavement, mental illness, murder, fraud and incest sexual abuse until November 2006 when her character was sent to jail for a life sentence.\n\nSince leaving Emmerdale, Chase appeared in episodes of My Family (2007) and Doctors (2009). In 2010, she took part in the \"Soap Star Special\" edition of the Channel 4 series Come Dine with Me. In 2011, She was a contestant on the ITV show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! which aired in late 2011. She was the fourth celebrity to be eliminated from the jungle on 27 November 2011, finishing in ninth place overall.\n\nIn September 2013, Chase returned to reprise her role of Steph Forsythe in Emmerdale, returning for the funeral of long running character Alan Turner, played by the late Richard Thorp. \n\nChase is a patron of the theatre charity The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America. \n\nIn December 2014, Chase appeared on the Christmas special of Pointless Celebrities, partnered with Christopher Biggins.\n\nOther work\n\nAs well as her various television credits, Chase has also appeared in a variety of stage productions, including pantomime, comedy and drama. Her first acting role following her Campari advertisements in the 1970s was in a play, The Undertaking, starring Kenneth Williams.  Since then she has appeared in stage productions of Pygmalion, Little Shop of Horrors, Me and My Girl, Tea For Two, and Run For Your Wife. In 2007, she toured the UK in a production of the thriller Dead Guilty. \n\nChase's film credits include the 1979 Charles Bronson film Love and Bullets, and the low budget 2002 British movie Living in Hope.\n\nShe also appeared as a guest in an episode of the BBC radio show Just A Minute, alongside regulars Clement Freud, Kenneth Williams and Peter Jones.\n\nShe was an interview guest on Parkinson in 1979, on an episode also featuring Kenneth Williams. She was a guest panellist on Loose Women in October 2012, to celebrate 40 years of Emmerdale.\n\nIn February 2013, Chase appeared and was interviewed on the breakfast television show Daybreak.\nQuestion:\n\"What was being advertised by Lorraine Chase when she used the words \"\"Nah, Luton Airport\"\"\"\nAnswer:\nCampari\nPassage:\nSamantha Weinberg\nSamantha Fletcher is a British Green politician, and under her maiden name of Samantha Weinberg, a novelist, journalist and travel writer.

Seven subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies.\n\nGeographic range \n\nCoachwhips range throughout the southern United States from coast to coast. They are also found in the northern half of Mexico.\n\nDescription \n\nCoachwhips are thin-bodied snakes with small heads and large eyes with round pupils. They vary greatly in color, but most reflect a proper camouflage for their natural habitat. M. f. testaceus is typically a shade of light brown with darker brown flecking, but in the western area of Texas, where the soil color is a shade of pink, the coachwhips are also pink in color. M. f. piceus was given its common name because specimens frequently, but not always, have some red in their coloration. Coachwhip scales are patterned so at first glance, the snake appears braided. Subspecies can be difficult to distinguish in areas where their ranges overlap. Adult sizes of 127 - are common. The record sized specimen, of the Eastern coachwhip race, was 259 cm.  Young specimens, mostly just over 100 cm in length, were found to have weighed 180 to, whereas good-sized mature adults measuring 163 to weighed in at .  \n\nHabitat\n\nCoachwhips are commonly found in open areas with sandy soil, open pine forests, old fields, and prairies. They thrive in sandhill scrub and coastal dunes.\n\nBehavior \n\nCoachwhips are diurnal, and actively hunt and eat lizards, small birds, and rodents. They tend to be sensitive to potential threats, and often bolt at the first sign of one; they are extremely fast-moving snakes. They are curious snakes with good eyesight, and are sometimes seen raising their heads above the level of the grass or rocks to see what is around them. Can slither up to 15 mph.\n\nSubspecies \n\n*Sonoran coachwhip, Masticophis flagellum cingulum Lowe & Woodin, 1954\n*Eastern coachwhip, Masticophis flagellum flagellum (Shaw, 1802)\n*Baja California coachwhip, Masticophis flagellum fuliginosus (Cope, 1895)\n*Lined coachwhip, Masticophis flagellum lineatulus H.M. Smith, 1941\n*Red coachwhip (Red racer), Masticophis flagellum piceus (Cope, 1892)\n*San Joaquin coachwhip, Masticophis flagellum ruddocki Brattstrom & Warren, 1953\n*Western coachwhip, Masticophis flagellum testaceus (Say, 1823)\n\nMyths \n\nThe primary myth concerning coachwhips, that they chase people, likely arises from the snake and the person both being frightened, and both just happening to be going the same way to escape. Coachwhips are fast snakes, often moving faster than a human, and thus give an impression of aggression should they move toward the person.\n\nThe legend of the hoop snake may refer to the coachwhip snakes.\n\nAnother myth of the rural southeastern United States is of a snake that, when disturbed, would chase a person down, wrap him up in its coils, whip him to death with its tail, and then make sure he is dead by sticking its tail up the victim's nose to see if he is still breathing. In actuality, coachwhips are neither constrictors (snakes that dispatch their prey by suffocating with their coils) nor strong enough to overpower a person. Also, they do not whip with their tails, even though their tails are long and look very much like a whips.\n\nTheir bites can be painful, but generally are harmless unless they become infected.\n\nIn parts of Mexico, where ranching is a way of life. These snakes are believed to wrap around the legs of cows and feed on their milk as if suckling leaving the nipple dry. They will also hook on any other mammal that produces milk. Leaving the young baby dehydrated. \n\nThere have also been rancher stories of \"chirrioneras\", is what they call them, hypnotizing women. They latch onto their breasts to feed. If the woman has a crying hungry baby the snake would stick their tail in the babies mouth to keep the baby quiet and leave undetected. The story goes that the only way to know if the snake has been there is if the baby has sores around the mouth. The most obvious is the baby is malnourished and getting weaker while the mother cannot feed her baby because her breast have been sucked dry.\nQuestion:\nCommonly found throughout the Southern USA and the Northern half of Mexico what type of creature is a Coachwhip?\nAnswer:\nSnake (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nEngland: All-time football records | Soccerlens\nEngland: All-time football records | Sportslens\nBlog People David Beckham England: All-time football records\nEngland: All-time football records\nlewisdoe 20 January, 2013 Columns , David Beckham , England , Fabio Capello , Football Stats , Lists , Michael Owen , Sven Goran Eriksson , Wayne Rooney\nEngland is where football began with some of the same rules used in the modern game first created by the original Football Association. And since, the Three Lions have always been a power house in international football.\nIn tournaments, they have always been a threat to their opposition. England have won the World Cup in 1966 and their best result in European Championships came in 1968 when they beat Soviet Union in the third place play-off after losing to Yugoslavia in the semifinal.\nThe England football crest\nHere are ten of the all-time greatest record of the England national football team:\nBiggest win\nYou have to go back as far as 1882 to find England’s biggest win which was a 13-0 thumping of Ireland.\nEngland put 13 past Ireland again in 1899 in a 13-2 win with the next biggest win an 11-1 demolition of Austria in 1908. The youngest big win for England came in 1982 with a 9-0 victory over Luxembourg at Wembley.\nWorst defeat\nThe biggest defeat that England have ever suffered is a 7-1 loss against the great Hungarians in 1954.\nEngland were also beaten 7-2 by Scotland in 1878 and they lost again to the Scots 6-1 just three years later.

Attila was a leader of the Hunnic Empire, a tribal confederation consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nDuring his reign, he was one of the most feared enemies of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. He crossed the Danube twice and plundered the Balkans, but was unable to take Constantinople. His unsuccessful campaign in Persia was followed in 441 by an invasion of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, the success of which emboldened Attila to invade the West. He also attempted to conquer Roman Gaul (modern France), crossing the Rhine in 451 and marching as far as Aurelianum (Orléans) before being defeated at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains.\n\nHe subsequently invaded Italy, devastating the northern provinces, but was unable to take Rome. He planned for further campaigns against the Romans but died in 453. After Attila's death his close adviser Ardaric of the Gepids led a Germanic revolt against Hunnic rule, after which the Hunnic Empire quickly collapsed.\n\nAppearance and character \n\nThere is no surviving first-hand account of Attila's appearance, but there is a possible second-hand source provided by Jordanes, who cites a description given by Priscus.\n\nSome modern scholars have suggested that this description is typically East Asian, because it has all the combined features that fit the physical type of people from Eastern Asia, and Attila's ancestors may have come from there.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe origin of the name \"Attila\" is unclear, and there's no consensus among scholars.\n\nOtto J. Maenchen-Helfen considered an East Germanic origin; Attila is formed from Gothic or Gepidic noun atta, \"father\", by means of the diminutive suffix -ila, meaning \"little father\". The Gothic etymology can be tracked up to Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm in the early 19th century. Maenchen-Helfen noted that Hunnic names were \"not the true names of the Hun princes and lords. What we have are Hunnic names in Germanic dress, modified to fit the Gothic tongue, or popular Gothic etymologies, or both\". Peter Heather, who strongly considered Germanic etymology of the name Attila and some of noble Huns, stated that the possibility Attila was of Germanic ancestry cannot be ruled out. The names of Attila's brother Bleda, and most powerful minister Onegesius, also have hypothetical Germanic etymology. Only credible Germanic etymology have Attila's blood relative Laudaricus, and certain Hun-Goth Ragnaris.\n\nHyun Jin Kim argued that the \"Germanization of Hunnic names may have been a conscious policy among the Hunnic elite in the West in order to ease the transition to their rule of formerly independent German tribal unions\". In the Western part of Hunnic Empire, where mostly lived subjected Gothic tribes, Huns probably spoke both Hunnic and Gothic language, and as such bore Germanized or Germanic name, like Laudaricus. Maenchen-Helfen also expressed concern over orthography of the writer, possible morphological change, that some names writers heard from the Goths, the tendency of Roman and Byzantine writers to alter foreign names, and manuscript corruption.\n\nHowever, Kim noted that those names considered by Heather to be Gothic, especially in this case of Attila and Bleda, have more natural and probable Turkic etymology. Heather also ignored the fact that all Hunnic rulers before Attila, as well his father Mundzuk, paternal uncles Octar, Ruga and Oebarsius, wife Kreka, father-in-law Eskam, and sons Ellac, Dengizich and Ernak, have names of Turkic origin.\n\nOmeljan Pritsak considered ̕Άττίλα (Atilla) a composite title-name which derived from Turkic *es (great, old), and *t il (sea, ocean), and the suffix /a/. The stressed back syllabic til assimilated the front member es, so it became *as.

Port is the left-hand side of or direction from a vessel, facing forward. Starboard is the right-hand side, facing forward. Since port and starboard never change, they are unambiguous references that are not relative to the observer. \n\nThe term starboard derives from the Old English steorbord, meaning the side on which the ship is steered. Before ships had rudders on their centrelines, they were steered with a steering oar at the stern of the ship and, because more people are right-handed, on the right-hand side of it. The term is cognate with the Old Norse stýri (rudder) and borð (side of a ship). Since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat, it would tie up at wharf on the other side. Hence the left side was called port.  \n\nFormerly larboard was used instead of port. This is from Middle-English ladebord and the term lade is related to the modern load. Larboard sounds similar to starboard and in 1844 the Royal Navy ordered that port be used instead.  Larboard continued to be used well into the 1850s by whalers. In Old English the word was bæcbord, of which cognates are used in other European languages, for example as the German backbord and the French term bâbord (derived in turn from Middle Dutch). \n\nAt night, the port side of a vessel or aircraft is indicated with a red navigation light and the opposite side with a green one, to help avoid collisions. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea state that a ship on the left must give way to a ship on its right. If the courses of two boats are intersecting, the helmsman usually gives way to a red light by going around the stern of the stand-on vessel. Sidelights are each lit from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on its corresponding side. A mnemonic for this is \"If to starboard red appear, 'tis your duty to keep clear. Green to green, red to red perfect safety, go ahead.\"\nQuestion:\nWhat colour light indicates the starboard side of a boat?\nAnswer:\nGreenishly\nPassage:\nMalcolm Morley\nMalcolm Morley (born June 7, 1931) is an English artist now living in the United States. He is best known as a photorealist.\n\nLife\n\nMorley was born in north London. He had a troubled childhood—after his home was blown up by a bomb during World War II, his family was homeless for a time —and did not discover art until serving a three-year stint in Wormwood Scrubs prison. After release, he studied art first at the Camberwell School of Arts and then at the Royal College of Art (1955–1957), where his fellow students included Peter Blake and Frank Auerbach. In 1956, he saw an exhibition of contemporary American art at the Tate Gallery, and began to produce paintings in an abstract expressionist style.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, Morley briefly taught at Ohio State University, and then moved back to New York City, where he taught at SUNY Stony Brook from 1970 through 1974 and the School of Visual Arts. In the early 1980s he was married to the Brazilian artist Marcia Grostein who, during that short and intense period, had a significant influence on his work, especially on his well known beach scenes watercolors.  He now lives in Bellport, New York in a former church that serves as his home/studio, which he has shared with his wife Lida Morley since 1986.  His work was featured as the first temporary exhibit at the Parrish Art Museum in Watermill, New York when it opened in November 2012. \n\nWork\n\nIn 1958, a year after leaving the Royal College, Morley moved to New York City, where he saw exhibitions of the work of Jackson Pollock and Balthus, both of whose treatment of their paintings' surfaces influenced him greatly. He considers Cézanne the quintessential sensationalist, and has acknowledged that artist's deep influence on his own work. When Morley moved to New York he also met Barnett Newman, and became influenced by him. He painted a number of works at this time made up of only horizontal black and white bands. He also met Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and, influenced in part by them, changed to a photorealist style (Morley prefers the phrase super realist). He often used a grid to transfer photographics images (often of ships) from a variety of sources (travel brochures, calendars, old paintings) to canvas as accurately as possible, and became one of the most noted photorealists.\n\nIn the 1970s, Morley's work began to be more expressionist, and he began to incorporate collage into his work. Many of his paintings from the mid-70s, such as Train Wreck (1975),  depict \"catastrophes\". Later in the decade, he began to use his own earlier drawings and watercolours as the subject for his paintings. In 1984, Morley won the inaugural Turner Prize. In the 1990s he returned again to a more precise photorealist style, often reproducing images from model aeroplane kits on large canvases.\n\nHis work often draws upon various sources in a process of cross-fertilization. For example, his painting The Day of the Locust (1977) draws its title from the novel The Day of the Locust, by Nathanael West. One scene in the painting is drawn from the opening scene of the novel, and other scenes are drawn from the 1954 film Suddenly and the 1925 Sergei Eisenstein film Battleship Potemkin.\n\nHis most significant student is his ex-wife, Fran Bull. Malcolm Morley is represented by Sperone Westwater, New York and Xavier Hufkens, Brussels.\n\nOther information\n\nRichard Milazzo has written the book Malcolm Morley in 2000, and Jean-Claude Lebensztijn wrote Malcolm Morley: Itineraries (Reaktion Books, 2001).\nQuestion:\nMalcolm Morley was the first winner of what in 1984?\nAnswer:\nTurner Prize\nPassage:\nRoy Plomley\nFrancis Roy Plomley, OBE (20 January 1914 – 28 May 1985) was an English radio broadcaster, producer, playwright and novelist.\n\nEarly life\n\nPlomley (pronounced Plumley) was born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, son of a pharmacist and was educated at King's College School, Wimbledon. On leaving school he worked first briefly for an estate agent, then for a London advertising agency, then in publishing.\nHis original aim was to be an actor, and he did secure very minor parts in a number of films (e g 'Double Confession' 1950), but he soon drifted into broadcasting, coming to public notice as an announcer, and later producer, for the International Broadcasting Company (IBC), starting on Radio Normandy in April 1936 and moving on at the end of that year to the IBC's Paris-based station, Poste Parisien. Between mid-1937 and late 1939 he was involved in writing and production, travelling back and forth between these two IBC stations in France and the company's offices and studios in London, while also presenting the variety programme Radio Normandy Calling, recorded on location in theatres at UK seaside resorts and regularly beating the BBC in audience ratings. \n\nWorld War II\n\nThis part of his career came to an abrupt end when commercial broadcasting from the continent was brought to a halt by World War II. Plomley and his new wife stayed on in Paris, only narrowly escaping back to the UK via a circuitous route through the chaos and panic of the Fall of France, losing all their possessions in the process, as German occupying forces approached the French capital in June 1940. \n\nDesert Island Discs\n\nThen, in 1941, he devised the BBC Radio series Desert Island Discs.\nIt was created on a cold November evening whilst Plomley was contemplating ideas and deciding whether to retire to bed or not. In the cottage he was living in at the time at Little Bushey Lane, Bushey, Hertfordshire, he wrote to Leslie Perowne, who was in charge of popular record programmes. He had a favourable reply and so, in his little back bedroom/study (still existing today) he set out his ideas with the names of personalities to be invited to participate. In those days of WWII every BBC Radio show was scripted by Plomley and submitted for censorship. In January 1942 the first of a series of eight weekly programmes was broadcast. Each show consisted of an interview with a celebrity, interspersed by the guest's choice of music. His contract was renewed for a further 15 shows. In the end he presented 1,791 editions of the programme stretching over 43 years. Its success was attributed to his skill as an interviewer and to his meticulous research. \n\nPlomley was succeeded as presenter by Michael Parkinson (1985–1988), then by Sue Lawley (1988–2006), and most recently by Kirsty Young. Desert Island Discs is the second longest-running radio programme in the world (after the Grand Ole Opry), and it is still running.\n\nUntil late September 2009, unlike many other BBC radio programmes, Desert Island Discs was unavailable for Listen Again on the BBC website. This was because, when Roy Plomley devised the programme, he was a freelance producer, and it had been argued therefore, that the 'format rights' of the programme belonged to him rather than to the BBC. At his death, those 'rights' passed to his widow, and the BBC were subsequently unable to negotiate the right to include Desert Island Discs in their Listen Again offering. It was announced on 27 September 2009 that an agreement had been reached with the family as to payment of royalties and it would be available via iPlayer. \n\nOther work\n\nPlomley's broadcasting career was not restricted to Desert Island Discs; he also compiled and presented several feature programmes and was the chairman of BBC Radio's game show Many a Slip from 1964 to 1979, and a participant in such panel games as Does the Team Think?, also on BBC Radio. He also anchored Round Britain Quiz in 1961. For television he produced Dinner Date with Death in 1949, claimed to be the first UK film made for TV, and in the same year chaired We Beg to Differ on BBC Radio, transferring with it to BBC Television in 1951.  He also wrote the screenplay for the 1953 film The Blakes Slept Here.\n\nPlomley was awarded the OBE in 1975. He was Chairman of the Radio and Television Writers' Association from 1957 to 1959, and was voted BBC Radio Personality of the Year in 1979. He published 16 stage plays (one of which, Cold Turkey, was put on in the West End), and one novel.  He was posthumously inducted into the Radio Academy's Hall of Fame. \n\nPlomley died in London from pleurisy in 1985 aged 71 and is buried at Putney Vale Cemetery.\nQuestion:\nRoy Plomley was, in 1944, the creator and first presenter of which radio programme?\nAnswer:\nDESERT ISLAND DISCS\nPassage:\nTurn on, tune in, drop out\n\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" is a counterculture-era phrase popularized by Timothy Leary in 1966. In 1967 Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and phrased the famous words, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". It was also the title of his spoken word album Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out recorded in 1966. On this lengthy album one can hear Leary speaking in a monotone, soft-spoken voice on his views about the world and humanity and describing nature, Indian symbols, \"the meaning of inner life\", the LSD experience, peace and many other issues.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was \"given to him\" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan \"was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a press conference in New York City on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of psychedelics by detaching themselves from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his League for Spiritual Discovery.  The phrase was derided by more conservative critics.\n\nIn his speech, Leary stated:\n\nLeary later explained in his 1983 autobiography Flashbacks:\n\nTurn on, tune in, drop out is also the title of a book (ISBN 1-57951-009-4) of essays by Timothy Leary, covering topics ranging from religion, education, and politics to Aldous Huxley, neurology, and psychedelic drugs.\n\nLeary later (during the February 1967 salon known as the Houseboat Summit) announced his agreement with a new ordering of the phrase as he said, \"I would agree to change the slogan to 'Drop out. Turn on. Drop in.'\" \n\nDuring his last decade, Leary proclaimed that the \"PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" — \"turn on, boot up, jack in\" reworked the existing phrase to suggest joining the cyberdelic counterculture. \n\nThe phrase was referenced in several songs of the time. Psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock parodies the quote in their 1967 song \"Incense and Peppermints\", singing \"Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around\" in one of the lines. Gil Scott-Heron criticised the concept in his 1970 poem and song The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, with the line \"You will not be able to plug in, turn on and \".\n\nThe lyrics, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" are included verbatim in several songs:\n*\"Turn On, Tune In\" by Threshold\n*\"Drop Out\" by Infected Mushroom\n*\"Turn On Tune In Drop Out\" by Cracker\n*\"Turn on, Tune in, Stay inert\" in \"Flash Delerium\" by MGMT\n*\"Turn On / Tune In / Drop Out\" on The Fugs' album Tenderness Junction\n* \"Tune In, Drop Out\" in \"Trigger Hippie\" by Morcheeba\n\nThe CSI episode title \"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead\" also parodies the quote, with the episode focusing on how two victims who are supposedly dead get up and walk away.\n\nA variation of the quote (\"Tune in, Turn on, Talknet\")  was used in the 1980s and early 1990s for NBC Radio's Talknet nighttime programming block of call-in advice shows.\nQuestion:\n\"Who was the American writer and counterculture icon who coined the phrase \"\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nTimothy o%60leary\nPassage:\nStompie Moeketsi\nJames Seipei (1974–1989), also known as Stompie Moeketsi, was a teenage United Democratic Front (UDF) activist from Parys in South Africa. He and three other boys were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United football club. Moeketsi was murdered on 1 January 1989, the only one of the boys to be killed. \n\nActivism\n\nMoeketsi joined the street uprising against apartheid in the mid-1980s at age ten, and soon took on a leading role. He became the country's youngest political detainee when he spent his 12th birthday in jail without trial.  At the age of 13 he was expelled from school.\n\nMurder\n\nMoeketsi, together with Kenny Kgase, Pelo Mekgwe and Thabiso Mono, were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 from the Methodist manse in Orlando, Soweto. Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer and after the 4 boys were kidnapped they were pleading and saying that Stompie isn't a police informer. Jerry Richardson, one of the members of Winnie Mandela's Football Club, was carrying a samurai-like sword before he closed the door and screams were heard as Stompie Moeketsi was murdered at the age of 14. His body was found on waste ground near Winnie Mandela's house on 6 January 1989, and recovered by the police. His throat had been cut. Jerry Richardson, one of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was convicted of the murder. He claimed that she had ordered him, with others, to abduct the four youths from Soweto, of whom Moeketsi was the youngest. The four were severely beaten.\n\nInvolvement of Winnie Mandela\n\nIn 1991, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault,  but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine and a two-year suspended sentence on appeal. In 1992 she was accused of ordering the murder of Dr. Abu-Baker Asvat, a family friend who had examined Seipei at Mandela's house, after Seipei had been abducted but before he had been killed.  Mandela's role was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, in 1997.  She was said to have paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989.  The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were being intimidated on Winnie Mandela's orders. \n\nThis incident became a cause célèbre for the apartheid government and opponents of the ANC, and Winnie Mandela's iconic status was dealt a heavy blow.\n\nAppearing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997, she said allegations that she was involved in at least 18 human rights abuses including eight murders were \"ridiculous\" and claimed that her main accuser, former comrade Katiza Cebekhulu, was a former \"mental patient\" and his allegations against her were \"hallucinations\".  The Commission found that the abduction had been carried out on Winnie Mandela's instructions, and that she had \"initiated and participated in the assaults\". However, with regard to the actual murder the Commission found Mandela only \"negligent\".\nQuestion:\nWhich famous name was accused f the abduction of Stompie Seipei?\nAnswer:\nNomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela\nPassage:\nSpencer Kelly\nSpencer Kelly (born 5 July 1973, Spencer John Bignell) is the presenter of the BBC's technology programme Click, broadcast on the BBC World News and the BBC News Channel  in the United Kingdom. He grew up in Bishopstoke, near Eastleigh in Hampshire and attended Wyvern Secondary School in Fair Oak, then Barton Peveril College in Eastleigh. He obtained a double first in Computer Science   at the University of Cambridge.  It was as a student that Kelly first became involved in broadcasting, initially at Radio Glen at Southampton University    and he went on to run Cambridge University Radio. After graduating he got a job as a traffic presenter - going by the name of \"Commander Kelly in the Flying Eye\" on the local radio station for Portsmouth and Southampton, Ocean FM and Power FM. He later became the station's breakfast show host, a position he held for six years.\n\nHe joined the BBC in January 2003 as one of five iPresenters (interactive presenters). The team pioneered new forms of interactive broadcasting, using the web, digital television and digital radio. This included interactive LiveChats, which were live interviews with celebrities, streamed across the web, in which the audience had the opportunity to ask live questions to the guests. He also began reporting for BBC World's Click Online show for two and a half years and appeared on Five's The Gadget Show. He became the presenter of the renamed Click series in January 2006, taking over from Stephen Cole.\n\nKelly was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Technology by Coventry University.

In modern Catalonia, the name refers to a spread similar to the French tapenade made of olives, anchovies, capers, sometimes mashed egg yolks, and either olive oil or butter.  This recipe, flavored with rum and a touch of mustard, is adapted from the one served at the Hotel Ampurdan in Figueres.  The hotel is legendary for its robust Catalan cooking and credited with naming this spread 'garum'.  Try to find olives that are pungent, but not vinegary and briny. The spread is delicious on toasted baguette rounds or slices of grilled country bread.  It also makes a fine accompaniment to grilled meat, chicken or fish.  Adapted from the cookbook, \"The New Spanish Table\"\nIngredients\nCopycat Olive Garden Recipes\nDirections\nPlace the olives, anchovies, capers, garlic, egg yolk, rum and mustard in a food processor and process in quick pulses to a medium-fine paste, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed.  Gradually add the olive oil, pulsing several times after each addition.  Scrape the mixture into a bowl and let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour so that the flavors develop.  Serve with grilled bread, toast or bread sticks.  The spread can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 weeks.\nNote:  if the only pitted olives you can find are Kalamatas, soak them briefly in cold water and use fewer capers and anchovies.  To pit olives, place them in a plastic bag.  Lay the bag on a flat surface, and crush them lightly with the flat side of a large knife, mallet or heavy skillet.  Then pick out and discard the pits.

It is located at 8901 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip. The club has been the launching pad for bands including The Doors, The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Steppenwolf, Van Halen, Johnny Rivers, Guns N' Roses and Mötley Crüe. In 2006, the venue was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \n\nHistory\n\nIn 1958, the first Whisky a Go-Go in North America opened in Chicago, Illinois, on the corner of Rush and Chestnut streets.    It has been called the first real American discothèque. A franchise was opened in 1966 on M Street in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., by restaurateur Jacques Vivien.\n\nIt owes its name to the first discothèque, the Whisky à Go-Go, established in Paris in 1947 by Paul Pacine. \n\nThe Sunset Strip Whisky was founded by Elmer Valentine, Phil Tanzini, Shelly Davis, and attorney Theodore Flier and opened on January 16, 1964.   In 1972, Valentine, Lou Adler, Mario Maglieri and others started the Rainbow Bar & Grill on the Sunset Strip. In 1966, Valentine, Adler and others founded The Roxy Theatre. Lou Adler bought into the Whisky in the late 1970s. Valentine sold his interest in the Whisky a Go Go in the 1990s but retained an ownership in the Rainbow Bar & Grill and the Roxy Theatre until his death in December 2008.\n\nAlthough the club was billed as a discothèque, suggesting that it offered only recorded music, the Whisky a Go Go opened with a live band led by Johnny Rivers and DJ Rhonda Lane, spinning records between sets from a suspended cage at the right of the stage.\n\nThe Whisky a Go Go was one of the places that popularized go-go dancing. Elmer Valentine, in a 2006 Vanity Fair article, recalled arranging to have a female DJ play records between Rivers' sets so patrons could continue dancing. But because there was not enough room on the floor for a DJ booth, he had a glass-walled booth mounted high above the floor.  A contest was held for the female DJ job but when the young winner called Valentine on the night of the opening and tearfully said her mother forbade her from doing it, Valentine recruited the club's cigarette girl, Patty Brockhurst. Valentine quickly hired two more female dancers, one of whom, Joanna Labean, designed the official go-go-girl costume of fringed dress and white boots.\n\nRivers rode the Whisky-born go-go craze to national fame with records recorded partly Live at the Whisky. In addition, The Miracles recorded the song \"Going to a Go-Go\" in 1966 (which was covered in 1982 by The Rolling Stones), and Whisky a Go Go franchises sprang up all over the country.  Arguably, the rock and roll scene in Los Angeles was born when the Whisky started operation; because of its status as an historic music landmark, the venue was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. \n\nThe Whisky played an important role in many musical careers, especially for bands based in Southern California. The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Smokestack Lightning, and Love were regulars, and The Doors were the house band for a while – until the debut of the \"Oedipal section\" of \"The End\" got them fired. Van Morrison's band Them had a two-week residency in June 1966, with The Doors as the opening act. On the last night they all jammed together on \"Gloria\". Frank Zappa's The Mothers of Invention got their record contract based on a performance at the Whisky. The Turtles performed there when their newest (and biggest-selling) single \"Happy Together\" was becoming a hit, only to lose their new bassist, Chip Douglas (who had arranged the song), to The Monkees; guitarist Michael Nesmith invited him to become their producer (he returned to the Turtles a year later, to produce them). Neil Diamond also played at the Whisky on occasion. Metallica bassist Cliff Burton was recruited by the band after they watched him play a show there. At one point singer and actress E.G. Daily had a residency at the Whisky.\n\nArthur Lee of Love immortalized the Whisky in the song \"Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale\". \"Here they always play my songs,\" he would sing on the side two opener of Forever Changes. The Whisky was located on the strip between the streets Clark and Hilldale. British rockers Status Quo also referenced the venue in their 1978 song \"Long Legged Linda\" with the lines, \"Well, if you're ever in Los Angeles and you've got time to spare / Take a stroll up Sunset Boulevard, you'll find the Whisky there.\"\n\nIn 1966, the Whisky was one of the centers of what fans call the Sunset Strip police riots. In the mid-1970s, the Whisky hosted stage presentations, including the long-running show The Cycle Sluts. During the early 1990s, the Whisky hosted a number of Seattle-based musicians who would be a part of the grunge movement, including Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Melvins, Fitz of Depression and 7 Year Bitch.  Johnny Elvis Foster, who was based in Los Angeles, also performed at the club multiple times in 1991 and 1992, and tracks recorded from a February 12, 1992 concert appear on their EP, Ask For It (1995). In 1997, System of a Down played at the Whisky. The band were unsigned at the time, and played songs from their early demo tapes, in particular containing the band's only live performance of the song \"Blue\".\nQuestion:\nWhat song by The Doors that has a strong reference to the Oedipus complex got them fired from the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in West Hollywood?\nAnswer:\n\"\"\"The End\"\"\"\nPassage:\nBritish Academy Film Awards\nThe British Academy Film Awards are presented in an annual award show hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). It is the British equivalent of the American Oscars and Australian AACTA Awards. As of 2008, it has taken place in Central London at the Royal Opera House, the latter having taken over from the flagship Odeon cinema on Leicester Square. The 69th British Academy Film Awards was held on 14 February 2016.\n\nHistory\n\nBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) was founded in 1947 as The British Film Academy, by David Lean, Alexander Korda, Carol Reed, Charles Laughton, Roger Manvell and others. In 1958, the Academy merged with The Guild of Television Producers and Directors to form The Society of Film and Television, which eventually became The British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1976.\n\nBAFTA stated charitable purpose is to \"support, develop and promote the art forms of the moving image, by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners and benefiting the public\". In addition to high profile awards ceremonies BAFTA runs a year-round programme of educational events including film screenings and tribute evenings. BAFTA is supported by a membership of about 6,000 people from the film, television and video game industries.\n\nThe Academy's awards are in the form of a theatrical mask designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe, which was commissioned by the Guild of Television Producers in 1955.\n\nAnnual ceremony\n\nThe ceremony previously took place in April or May and since 2002 it takes place in February in order to precede the Oscars.

He presented a wide variety of shows from the 1960s onwards.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Newton Abbot, Devon, he grew up in the north-west of the county, attending Barnstaple Grammar School  on Park Lane in Barnstaple. His father was a carpenter.\n\nCareer\n\nHe worked for the North Devon Journal Herald from the age of 17 and various newspapers, becoming the Sports Editor of the Western Morning News in Plymouth. He joined Westward Television in 1961, though he worked for the BBC for the majority of his broadcasting career. He joined the BBC, to work on BBC2 in 1966. He was working at BBC2 even though Westward Television were not aware of this because at the time BBC2 could not be received in the South West. An article in the Daily Mail led to Westward TV learning about his BBC work and he had to resign from Westward TV.\n\nProgrammes he hosted include Sportscene, It's a Knockout (1967–1971), Jeux Sans Frontieres, Miss UK, Miss World, Quiz Ball, Rugby Special, Match of the Day, A Question of Sport (1970–1977 AND 1989), Grandstand, Superstars, Starshot, Ski Sunday (1978–1996) and the BBC's Winter and Summer Olympic Games coverage. \n\nHe provided the BBC TV commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, also hosting the preview shows of the international entries, and compèred the 1975 Miss World broadcast, the latter resulting in some embarrassment because he found it difficult to understand what many of the contestants were saying. He was the first presenter to introduce the tennis championships at Wimbledon (1967) in colour. He presented Wimbledon highlights until 1982 and also BBC's Show Jumping coverage.\n\nHe was the anchorman at the World Snooker Championships at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, from 1978 – the first year the BBC covered the championships daily – until his retirement in 2000 as well as the Grand Prix, UK Championship and the Masters. Vine's supposed friendship with Steve Davis was parodied in a Spitting Image sketch in which Davis boasted, \"I'm a mate of David Vine\".\n\nHis final work for the BBC was covering the weightlifting at the 2000 Sydney Olympics which he had done since the 1970s, after which he retired owing to a heart condition. He had contributed to programmes on the ESPN Classic channel. He had a coronary artery triple bypass operation in 2001,  and he died of a heart attack on 11 January 2009  aged 74 at his home near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married his first wife, Shirley, in 1958. They had met through amateur dramatics and had three children - Kim, Catherine and Martin; who lived together in Castleton Close, Mannamead, Plymouth; she died in 1970. He married his second wife, Mandy, in 1972 in Wokingham. They had a son. \n\nHe also had 4 grandchildren: Ben, Georgia, Oliver and Emily.\nQuestion:\nDavid Vine, David Coleman and Sue Barker have all hosted which BBC television quiz show?\nAnswer:\nA Question of sport\nPassage:\n2013 Nobel Peace Prize\nThe 2013 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, for their \"extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons\". The award citation indicated the organization was awarded the prize, because they “have defined the use of chemical weapons as taboo under international law. Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.”   The committee criticized Russia and the United States for not meeting the extended deadline for destruction of its chemical weapons, and noted that certain countries \"are still not members\". The OPCW was the 22nd organization to be awarded the prize. \n\nNomination\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee announced on 4 March 2013, it had received 259 nominations for the prize. This was the highest number of nominations ever: 18 more than the previous record year 2011. Of those 259 nominations, 50 were for organizations. \n\nAnnouncement\n\nThe winner of the Award was announced on 11 October 2013. The press release indicated that the OPCW was awarded the prize for \"its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons\". The announcement further reiterated the development of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which establishes the OPCW, as well as earlier instruments such as the Geneva Convention of 1925, but also indicated the use of chemical weapons during World War II and afterwards \"by both states and terrorists\".\n\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria was also mentioned as a recent event underscoring the importance of elimination of chemical weapons. The OPCW contributed to the UN mission investigating the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta   and its activities since 1 October entailed supervision of destruction activities, which followed the accession of Syria to the Chemical Weapons Convention (and its provisional application), OPCW Executive Council Decision EC-M-33/DEC.1.  and was mandated via the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118.\n\nThe Nobel Committee was critical towards Russia and the United States for not meeting their extended deadlines for the full destruction of its chemical weapons in 2012,  and mentioned that some states \"are still not members\". Non-member states of the OPCW are the states which are not party to the Chemical Weapons Convention: Angola, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, North Korea and South Sudan. \n\nCommittee\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. For the 2013 award, the members were: \n\n*Thorbjørn Jagland (chair, born 1950), former President of the Storting and former Prime Minister\n*Kaci Kullmann Five (deputy chair, born 1951), former member of Parliament and cabinet minister.\n*Inger-Marie Ytterhorn (born 1941), former member of Parliament.\n*Berit Reiss-Andersen (born 1954), former state secretary for the Minister of Justice and the Police.\n*Gunnar Stålsett (born 1935), former bishop of Oslo.\n\nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an intergovernmental organisation, located in The Hague, Netherlands. The organisation promotes and verifies the adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits the use of chemical weapons and requires their destruction. The organization was established on 29 April 1997, upon the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The verification consists both of evaluation of declarations by member states and on-site inspections. The principal body of the organization is the \"conference of states parties\", which normally is convened yearly. The Executive Council is the executive organ of the organisation and consists of 41 States Parties. The \"Technical Secretariat\" applies most of the activities mandated by the Council and is the body where most of the employees of the organisation work. Ahmet Üzümcü is Director-General of the OPCW. \n\nAll 190 parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention are automatically members of the OPCW.  Non-members are Israel and Myanmar, which are signatory states that have not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and Angola, Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan, which have neither signed nor acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. \n\nReaction\n\nOPCW Director-General Ahmet Üzümcü told reporters that he hoped his organisation's work would help \"to achieve peace in that country [Syria] and end the suffering of its people.\" \n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the organisation's work. \n\nUSA Today quoted a London-based Syrian opposition activist who doubted Syrian people would be celebrating the award.  Similarly, a spokesperson for the Syrian National Coalition labelled the prize \"ironic\". \n\nPakistani politician Imran Khan called on the USA and Russia to destroy their own chemical weapons.\nQuestion:\nWhich organisation won the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize?\nAnswer:\nOPWC\n\n\nPassage:\nRITA COOLIDGE ALL TIME HIGH James Bond 007 OCTOPUSSY The ...\nRITA COOLIDGE  ALL TIME HIGH James Bond 007 OCTOPUSSY The val doonican show 1983 - YouTube\nRITA COOLIDGE  ALL TIME HIGH James Bond 007 OCTOPUSSY The val doonican show 1983\nWant to watch this again later?\nSign in to add this video to a playlist.\nNeed to report the video?\nSign in to report inappropriate content.\nRating is available when the video has been rented.\nThis feature is not available right now.

Prestwick had both hosted and organised the Championship from 1860 to 1870.\n\nBy the time that Prestwick had reached agreement with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (based at Musselburgh) for the championship to rotate at these three venues, more than a year had passed. So, there was no event in 1871.\n\nEach club contributed £10 to the cost of the new trophy, which is inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', and was made by Mackay Cunningham & Company of Edinburgh.\n\nWhen the 1872 event was played, the trophy still wasn't ready in time to be presented to Morris (who had won his fourth in a row) although his name was the first to be engraved on it. In 1872, Morris was presented with a medal as have all subsequent winners.\n\nIn 1873 Tom Kidd became the first winner to be actually presented with the Claret Jug after winning the Championship.\n\nThe original Claret Jug has been on permanent display at the clubhouse of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1928. The original Challenge Belt is also on display at the same site, having been donated in 1908 by the Morris family.\n\nThe current Claret Jug was first awarded to Walter Hagen for winning the 1928 Open. The winner must return the trophy before the next year's Open, and receives a replica to keep permanently. Three other replicas exist — one in the British Museum of Golf at St Andrews, and two used for travelling exhibitions.\n\nEvery year, the winner's name is engraved on the Claret Jug before it is presented to him. The BBC always shows the engraver poised to start work, and the commentators like to speculate about when he will be sure enough of the outcome to begin. However, at the 1999 Open Championship, Jean van de Velde's name was engraved on the trophy before he famously choked with a triple-bogey on the 18th hole and Paul Lawrie subsequently won the playoff. Upon being awarded the Jug in 1989, Mark Calcavecchia said, \"How's my name going to fit on that thing?\" \n\nThe Claret Jug has twice appeared on commemorative £5 Scottish banknotes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland: first in 2004, for the 250th Anniversary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, then in 2005, the jug is shown held by Jack Nicklaus to mark his retirement.\nQuestion:\nThe Claret Jug is the name of the trophy awarded to the winner of which annual sporting championship?\nAnswer:\nOpen Golf Championship\nPassage:\nRing of Bright Water (film)\nRing of Bright Water is a 1969 British  feature film starring Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna. It is a story about a Londoner and his pet otter living on the Scottish coast. The story is fictional, but is adapted from the 1960 autobiographical book of the same name by Gavin Maxwell.  It featured the stars of Born Free, another movie about a close relationship between humans and a wild animal. The film has been released to VHS (1981) and to DVD (2002).\n\nPlot\n\nGraham Merrill (Bill Travers) passes a pet shop on his daily walks about London and takes an interest in an otter (specifically, a male river otter) in the window, eventually buying and naming the animal Mij.  The otter wreaks havoc in his small apartment and together they leave London for a rustic cottage overlooking the sea on the west coast of Scotland.  There they live as beachcombers and make the acquaintance of Dr. Mary (Virginia McKenna) from the nearby village, and her dog Johnny. Mij and Johnny play in the water and bound across the fields together.  \n\nMij's inquisitive and adventurous nature leads him some distance from the cottage to a female otter with whom he spends the day. Ignorant of danger, he is caught in a net and nearly killed. The humans find him and help him recover. Graham spends a significant amount of time drawing Mij but realises that to show the true agility of the otter he must draw it underwater. He builds a large tank out of old windows so that he can do this.\n\nNot long after, Merrill goes to London to look after some affairs and leaves Mary in charge of Mij. While being exercised afield, Mij is killed by a ditchdigger, who did not realize he was a pet. Merrill returns and is crushed to discover the death of his beloved otter. Some time later, Merrill and Mary are surprised by a trio of otter youngsters, accompanied by their mother otter, approaching the cottage. He happily realizes they are Mij's female mate and their children who have come to play in their father's swimming pool.\n\nGraham had been trying to write a novel on the Marsh Arabs for years; however, after seeing the baby otters playing, he takes pen and paper and begins to write about Mij and what the otter has taught him about himself.\n\nCast and characters\n\n* Bill Travers as Graham Merrill \n* Virginia McKenna as Mary MacKenzie \n* Peter Jeffrey as Colin Wilcox \n* Jameson Clark as Storekeeper \n* Helena Gloag as Mrs. Flora Elrich \n* W. D. Joss as Lighthouse keeper \n* Roddy McMillan as Bus driver \n* Jean Taylor-Smith as Mrs. Sarah Chambers\n* Christopher Benjamin as Fishmonger\n* Archie Duncan as Road mender\n* Tommy Godfrey as Ticket seller\n* Phil McCall as Frank\n* Two Wisconsin otters owned and trained by Tom and Mabel Beecham of Phillips, Wisconsin  portrayed Mij the otter.\n\nFilming\n\nPart of the film was shot in Ellenabeich on the Isle of Seil.\n\nReception and critical response\n\nThe film earned rentals of $1 million in North America and $1.4 million in other countries. After all costs were deducted it recorded an overall loss of $615,000.\n\nThe National Board of Review placed Ring of Bright Water on its list of the Top Ten Films for 1969.  In 2005, The Daily Telegraph called it \"one of the best-loved British films of all time.\" \n\nComic book\n\nGold Key Comics, an imprint of Western Publishing, published a comic book adaptation of the film drawn by Jack Sparling in October 1969. \n\nDocumentary\n\nThe 1995 documentary film Echoes of Camusfearna contains previously unseen footage of Gavin Maxwell with the otters and is introduced and narrated by Virginia McKenna. It was released to DVD in 2007. \n\nHome media\n\nThe film was released as a region 2 DVD in 2002, and as a region 1 DVD in 2004 (see cover art).  It had been released as a VHS tape in 1981 and 1991.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the book 'Ring of Bright Water’?\nAnswer:\nCamusfeàrna\nPassage:\nOrgan (anatomy)\nIn biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function.  In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form.   \n\nOrgans are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and \"sporadic\" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. \n\nA hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch, such as the stomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary bladder.\n\nOrgan systems \n\nTwo or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems.\n\nMammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.\n* Cardiovascular system: pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels.\n* Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus.\n* Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands.\n* Excretory system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine.\n* Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels that transport it including the Immune system: defending against disease-causing agents with leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen.\n* Integumentary system: skin, hair and nails.\n* Muscular system: movement with muscles.\n* Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord and nerves.\n* Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis.\n* Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm.\n* Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.\n\nOther animals\n\nThe organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.\n\nPlants\n\nThe study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.\n\nThe vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is asexual vegetative reproduction, the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word \"organ\" derives from the Latin ', meaning \"instrument\", itself from the Greek word , ' (\"implement; musical instrument; organ of the body\"). The Greek word is related to , ' (\"work\").Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as \"guts\" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, \"innards\".\n\nAristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract \"parts\" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the \"organon\").\n\nThe English word \"organism\" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. \n\nThe adjective visceral, also splanchnic, is used for anything pertaining to the internal organs. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. This practice remains an important ritual in some remote, tribal societies.\n\nThe term \"visceral\" is contrasted with the term \"\", meaning \"of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity\". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.\n\n7 Vital Organs of Antiquity\n\nSome alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhich organ of the body produces bile\nAnswer:\nImpressio duodenalis\nPassage:\nNegroni\nThe Negroni cocktail is made of one part gin, one part vermouth rosso (red, semi-sweet), and one part Campari, garnished with orange peel.  It is considered an apéritif.\n\nHistory\n\nWhile the drink's origins are unknown, the most widely reported account is that it was firstly mixed in Florence, Italy, in 1919, at Caffè Casoni, ex Caffè Giacosa located in via Tornabuoni and now called Caffè Roberto Cavalli.  Count Camillo Negroni concocted it by asking the bartender, Fosco Scarselli, to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano, by adding gin rather than the normal soda water. The bartender also added an orange garnish rather than the typical lemon garnish of the Americano to signify that it was a different drink.     After the success of the cocktail, the Negroni Family founded Negroni Distillerie in Treviso, Italy, and produced a ready-made version of the drink, sold as Antico Negroni 1919.  One of the earliest reports of the drink came from Orson Welles in correspondence with the Coshocton Tribune while working in Rome on Cagliostro in 1947, where he described a new drink called the Negroni, \"The bitters are excellent for your liver, the gin is bad for you. They balance each other.\"  \n\nCocktail historian David Wondrich has researched Camillo Negroni, who was born on 25 May 1868 to Enrico Negroni and Ada Savage Landor, and died in Florence on 25 September 1934. While his status as a count is questionable, his grandfather, Luigi Negroni, was indeed a count. \n\nDescendants of General  Pascal Olivier de Negroni, Count de Negroni claim that he was the Count Negroni who invented the drink in 1857 in Senegal. \"A  Corse Matin\" Sunday Edition article dated 2 February 1980 is translated on a descendant's blog: this claims he invented the drink around 1914.  An article in the New Hampshire Union Leader reported on the controversy. \n\nVariations \n\n* The Negroni sbagliato is made in the same way as the Negroni, but replacing the gin with sparkling white wine, or Prosecco. \n* Americano – 1 oz Campari, 1 oz Sweet Red Vermouth, a splash of soda\n* Boulevardier – A similar cocktail that uses whiskey in place of gin.\n* The Dutch Negroni substitutes Jenever for the London dry style gin in the original recipe. \n* Old Pal uses dry vermouth and Canadian rye whisky\n* Hanky-Panky – 1 oz Fernet, 1 oz Sweet Red Vermouth, 1 oz Gin\n*  Negronski - substitute vodka for gin in the original Negroni recipe.\nQuestion:\nThe cocktail called a Negroni has three alcoholic ingredients, gin and sweet vermouth are two of them: what is the third?\nAnswer:\nCampari\nPassage:\nDogsbody\nA dogsbody, or less commonly dog robber in the Royal Navy, is a junior officer, or more generally someone who does drudge work. A rough American equivalent would be a \"gofer,\" \"grunt\"  or \"lackey\". \n\nHistory\n\nThe Royal Navy used dried peas and eggs boiled in a bag (pease pudding) as one of their staple foods circa the early 19th century. Sailors nicknamed this item \"dog's body\". In the early 20th century, junior officers and midshipmen who performed jobs that more senior officers did not want to do began to be called \"dogsbodies\". The term became more common in non-naval usage ca. 1930, referring to people who were stuck with rough work.\n\nThe term dogsbody has not always been derogatory, with a number of people deliberately using it as their callsign or handle. The most famous of these is probably Douglas Bader, who was an RAF fighter pilot during the Second World War.\nQuestion:\nWhich ace nicknamed ‘Dogsbody’ was a prisoner in Colditz as WW2 came to an end?\nAnswer:\nGroup Captain Douglas R S Bader, CBE, DSO and Bar, DFC and Bar\nPassage:\nMotorsport\nMotorsport or motorsports is a global term used to encompass the group of competitive events which primarily involve the use of motorised vehicles, whether for racing or non-racing competition.  The terminology can also be used to describe forms of competition of two-wheeled motorised vehicles under the banner of motorcycle racing, and includes off-road racing such as motocross.\n\nFour- (or more) wheeled motorsport competition is globally governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA); and the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) governs two-wheeled competition.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1894, a French newspaper organised a race from Paris to Rouen and back, starting city to city racing.  In 1900, the Gordon Bennett Cup was established.  Closed circuit racing arose as open road racing, on public roads, was banned.  Brooklands was the first dedicated motor racing track in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing World War I, European countries organised Grand Prix races over closed courses.  In the United States, dirt track racing became popular.\n\nAfter World War II, the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised.  In the United States, stock car racing and drag racing became firmly established.\n\nMotorsports ultimately became divided by types of motor vehicles into racing events, and their appropriate organisations.\n\nOpen-wheel racing\n\nOpen-wheel racing is a set of classes of motor vehicles, with their wheels outside of, and not contained by any bodywork of their vehicle.  These have been globally classified as specific 'Formula' series - the most common being Formula One, and many others include the likes of Formula 3, Formula Ford, Formula Renault and Formula Palmer Audi.  However, in North America, the IndyCar series is their pinnacle open-wheeled racing series.  More recently, new open-wheeled series have been created, originating in Europe, which omit the 'Formula' moniker, such as GP2 and GP3.  Former 'Formula' series include Formula 5000 and Formula Two.\n\nFormula One\n\nFormula One is a class of single seat grand prix closed course racing, governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and currently organized by the privately owned company Formula One Group.  The formula is a very strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight and size. \n\nIndyCar Series\n\nIn the United States, Indy Car is a class of single seat paved track racing, organized by  INDYCAR.  Its premier race is the Indianapolis 500.\n\nEnclosed wheel racing\n\nEnclosed wheel racing is a set of classes of vehicles, where the wheels are primarily enclosed inside the bodywork of the vehicle, similar to a North American 'stock car'.\n\nSports car racing\n\nSports car racing is a set of classes of vehicles, over a closed course track, including sports cars, and specialised racing types.  The premiere race is the 24 Hours of Le Mans which takes place annually in France during the month of June.  Sports car racing rules and specifications differentiate in North America from established international sanctioning bodies. \n\nStock car racing\n\nStock car racing is a set of vehicles, that race over a speedway track, organised by NASCAR.  While once stock cars, the vehicles are now purpose built, but resemble the body design and shape of production cars.  NASCAR was organised in 1947, to combine flat track oval racing of production cars.   Daytona Beach and Road Course was founded where land speed records were set on the beach, and including part of A1A.\n\nTouring car racing\n\nTouring car racing is a set of vehicles,  modified street cars, that race over closed purpose built race tracks and street courses.\n\nOther racing\n\nMotor sports which involve competitors racing against each other include:\n*Auto (car) racing\n*Motor rallying\n*Motorcycle racing\n*Air racing\n*Kart racing\n*Boat racing\n*Hovercraft racing\n*Lawn mower racing\n*Snowmobile racing\n*Truck racing\n\nNon-racing motorsport\n\nForms of motorsport which do not involve racing include drifting, regularity rally, motorcycle trials, gymkhana, Freestyle Motocross and tractor pulling.\n\nOlympics\n\nMotorsport was a demonstration event at the 1900 Summer Olympics.\nQuestion:\nWhat famous French endurance motor racing track/city is named after the early inhabiting Cenomani Celtic people?\nAnswer:\nManceaux\nPassage:\nHappiness is a cigar called Hamlet\n\"Happiness is a cigar called Hamlet\" is one of the best remembered British advertising campaigns for a tobacco product. It was a long-running campaign for Hamlet Cigars, lasting on television until all tobacco advertising on television was banned in the UK in 1991.[http://www.newash.org.uk/ash_2cb51gz3_archive.htm Tobacco Key Dates in the Campaign to ban Tobacco Advertising | ASH] They returned in cinemas in 1996, continuing there until 1999,  with the final commemorative advert and the modified Tagline, \"Happiness will always be a cigar called Hamlet.\"  \n\nHistory \n\nCommercials used an excerpt from a jazz rendition of Bach's Air on the G String, played by Jacques Loussier and his trio, which is still frequently associated with the brand. \n\nThe advertisements featured in television, radio and cinema commercials, various print media, and on billboards. The slogan and the entire campaign was created by the Collett Dickenson Pearce agency in 1966. The premise is that a man finds himself in an awkward or embarrassing situation and lights a Hamlet cigar. Lighting and smoking this cigar makes him smile and forget his woes. The campaign branched out from traditional advertising, even publishing a book of cartoons based on the idea.\n\nA memorable ident featured the 1982 Channel 4 blocks forming the number 5, then rewinding and then forming a jumbled mess, which then turns into a face and then smokes a cigar, making it smile.\n\nThese adverts were often mocked, most notably on The Kenny Everett Television Show.\n\nFilm Directors \n\nNumerous advertising filmmaker, including:\n\n* Barry Myers (director)\n\nCelebrity appearances \n\nNumerous celebrities appeared in the adverts, including:\n\n* Ian Botham \n* Ronnie Corbett\n* Gregor Fisher in the guise of his \"Baldy Man\" character (from Naked Video), attempting to use a photo booth \n\nRecognition \n\nThe advert was listed as the eighth greatest television advertisement of all time by Channel 4 in 2000. Both the original Channel 4 ident and a Hamlet advert spoofing the ident were made by Martin Lambie-Nairn.  Furthermore, the advert was ranked as the ninth greatest advertisement in an ITV list made in 2005  and as the third funniest television advertisement ever by Campaign Live in 2008.\nQuestion:\nWhich product was advertised to the tune of Bach's 'Air On A G-String'?\nAnswer:\nHAMLET CIGARS\nPassage:\nOrgan (anatomy)\nIn biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function.  In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form.   \n\nOrgans are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and \"sporadic\" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. \n\nA hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch, such as the stomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary bladder.\n\nOrgan systems \n\nTwo or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems.\n\nMammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.\n* Cardiovascular system: pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels.\n* Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus.\n* Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands.\n* Excretory system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine.\n* Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels that transport it including the Immune system: defending against disease-causing agents with leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen.\n* Integumentary system: skin, hair and nails.\n* Muscular system: movement with muscles.\n* Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord and nerves.\n* Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis.\n* Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm.\n* Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.\n\nOther animals\n\nThe organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.\n\nPlants\n\nThe study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.\n\nThe vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is asexual vegetative reproduction, the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word \"organ\" derives from the Latin ', meaning \"instrument\", itself from the Greek word , ' (\"implement; musical instrument; organ of the body\"). The Greek word is related to , ' (\"work\").Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as \"guts\" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, \"innards\".\n\nAristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract \"parts\" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the \"organon\").\n\nThe English word \"organism\" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. \n\nThe adjective visceral, also splanchnic, is used for anything pertaining to the internal organs. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. This practice remains an important ritual in some remote, tribal societies.\n\nThe term \"visceral\" is contrasted with the term \"\", meaning \"of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity\". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.\n\n7 Vital Organs of Antiquity\n\nSome alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhich organ is responsible for regulating the blood sugar level?\nAnswer:\nInferior surfaces of the pancreas\nPassage:\nHarold Sakata\n, (July 1, 1920 – July 29, 1982) was an American Olympic weightlifter, professional wrestler, and film actor. He won a silver medal for the United States at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London in weightlifting. He was also an actor, with his most famous role as the villain Oddjob in the James Bond film Goldfinger.\n\nHe was born in Holualoa, Hawaii and was of Japanese descent.\n\nCareer\n\nToshiyuki Sakata () was born on July 1, 1920 in Holualoa, Hawaii. He moved to the United States mainland and began to go by the more Western name \"Harold.\" At the age of eighteen, he weighed only 113 lb (8 st 1 lb) (51 kg) at a height of 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m). Wanting to \"look as good as the other guys\", he started lifting weights. He spent his early life training as a weightlifter and won a silver medal for the United States at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, lifting a total of 410 kg in the light-heavyweight division. He also did a stint as a professional wrestler under the name Tosh Togo from the early 1950s until the early 1960s, becoming Canadian Tag Team Champion. \n\nBond producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli took notice of Sakata because of his heavy build— he stood 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and weighed 284 lb (129 kg)—which, when coupled with his intimidating gaze, made him the perfect choice for the part of Oddjob. He had no acting background at all besides pro wrestling but the film character was to be mute and would require little theatrical skill. Before Sakata had secured the role of Oddjob, another former wrestler, British actor Milton Reid, had auditioned for the role.  In 1964 Reid challenged Sakata to a wrestling contest and suggested that the winner ought to get the role. However, given that Reid had been in Dr. No and that his character had been killed off, the producers decided to go with Sakata and the wrestling match did not take place. \n\nAs Oddjob, he was bodyguard to Bond villain Auric Goldfinger and his sharpened, steel-brimmed bowler hat became a famous and much-parodied trademark of the Bond series. While filming Oddjob's death scene, Sakata's hand was badly burnt, but he held on until he heard director Guy Hamilton say \"Cut\".\n\nSakata appeared in several other movies in similar roles and took on \"Oddjob\" as an informal middle name (in the films Mako: The Jaws of Death and The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington he was credited as Harold \"Oddjob\" Sakata).\n\nWith time, Sakata's acting skills improved. He co-starred opposite William Shatner in the movie Impulse, in which he played the character Karate Pete. He also guest starred on a Gilligan's Island episode as Rory Calhoun's henchman,  and an episode of The Rockford Files.In 1971, Sakata was a regular on the short-lived TV series, Sarge, starring George Kennedy.\n\nHe appeared as Oddjob in a series of TV commercials for Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup in the 1970s. The advertisement showed Oddjob with a nasty cough, which results in him demolishing the neighborhood and frightening a woman inside her house as his cough spasms grow worse and worse. The woman grabs a bottle of Vicks Formula 44 and races for the door, only to see Oddjob karate chop through it.  She quickly opens the door and gives him a spoonful of the cough syrup, which cures his cough.  The two bow to each other, and the woman looks past Oddjob to see the destruction he has caused. He made an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on which he parodied the commercial by destroying Carson's set.\n\nSakata died of liver cancer on July 29, 1982, in St Francis Hospital, Honduras.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\n*Maple Leaf Wrestling\n*NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Great Togo\n\n*Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling\n*NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-Atlantic version) (1 time) – with Ike Eakins\n\n*NWA Big Time Wrestling\n*NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n\n*NWA Hollywood Wrestling\n*NWA International Television Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Wild Red Berry (1)   and Great Togo (1)\n*NWA World Tag Team Championship (Los Angeles version) (1 time) – with “Wild” Red Berry\n\n*NWA Mid-America\n*NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) (1 time) – with John Smith\n\n*Mid-Pacific Promotions\n*NWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n*NWA Hawaii Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with King Curtis Iaukea\n\n*Pacific Northwest Wrestling\n*NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Toi Yamamoto\n\n*World Wrestling Council\n*WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\n\nFilmography\n\nFeature films\n\n* Goldfinger (1964) .....

The dish was first popularized in New York City.  Many variations on the basic recipe are served.\n\nOrigin \n\nThere are conflicting accounts as to the origin of Eggs Benedict. \n\nIn an interview recorded in the \"Talk of the Town\" column of The New Yorker in 1942, the year before his death,  Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, claimed that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered \"buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon, and a hooker of hollandaise\". Oscar Tschirky, the famed maître d'hôtel, was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham for the bacon and a toasted English muffin for the toast. Notes: This hasn't been verified at the source, but is instead taken from the letter to Karpf by Cutts Benedict and the page of J. J. Schnebel.\n\nAnother claim to the creation of Eggs Benedict was circuitously made by Edward P. Montgomery on behalf of Commodore E. C. Benedict. In 1967 Montgomery wrote a letter to then The New York Times food columnist Craig Claiborne which included a recipe he claimed to have received through his uncle, a friend of the commodore. Commodore Benedict's recipe — by way of Montgomery — varies greatly from chef Ranhofer's version,  particularly in the hollandaise sauce preparation — calling for the addition of \"hot, hard-cooked egg and ham mixture\". \n\nVariations\n\nSeveral variations of Eggs Benedict exist.\n* Eggs Blackstone substitutes streaky bacon for the ham and adds a tomato slice.   \n* Eggs Blanchard substitutes Béchamel sauce for Hollandaise. \n* Eggs Florentine substitutes spinach for the ham or adds it underneath. \"eggs Florentine ($3.95), eggs poached and topped with Hollandaise sauce, served on spinach and English muffin\" Notes: Not directly verified. Viewed through Google News Archive snippet view.   Older versions of eggs Florentine add spinach to poached or shirred eggs.\n* Eggs Mornay substitutes Mornay (cheese) sauce for the Hollandaise.\n* Eggs Atlantic, Eggs Hemingway, or Eggs Copenhagen (also known as Eggs Royale and Eggs Montreal in New Zealand) substitutes salmon or smoked salmon for the ham. This is a common variation found in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom. This is also known as \"Eggs Benjamin\" in some restaurants in Canada.\n* Huevos Benedictos substitutes either sliced avocado or Mexican chorizo for the ham, and is topped with both a salsa (such as salsa roja or salsa brava) and hollandaise sauce.\n* Eggs Hussarde substitutes Holland rusks for the English muffin and adds Bordelaise sauce.

This first one is taken from ‘The Riddle’ by Thomas Hardy: ‘Stretching eyes west/Over the sea,/Wind foul or fair,/Always stood she/Prospect impressed;/Solely out there/Did her gaze rest,/Never elsewhere/Seemed charm to be.’ As the chapters progress, it becomes apparent that this quotation offers a fair description of the eponymous heroine.\nThe narrative begins in March 1867 and with a description of Lyme Bay in England. A man and woman are walking down the quay at Lyme Regis on a sharp and blustery morning. The Cobb, which is a 700-year-old sea-rampart, is described as the most beautiful on the south coast of England.\nThe first-person narrator says the Cobb has changed little ‘since the year of which I write’, but Lyme Regis has. In 1867, this town lies to the east of where the Cobb runs back to the land. Sombre gray cliffs lie to the west and there are dense woods above and beyond them.\nThe narrative returns to the couple and how the local spy might think the two are strangers and ‘people of some taste’. The young lady is dressed fashionably, more so than the ladies of the area, There is also another figure on the Cobb, which is dressed in black and standing motionless whilst staring out to sea. It is described as ‘more like a living memorial to the drowned, a figure from myth, than any proper fragment of the petty provincial day’.\nOne of the epigraphs introducing Chapter Two makes references to the surplus of women in the nineteenth century. The chapter itself begins with the man (Charles Smithson) and the woman (Tina, or rather, Ernestina as she is usually referred to) walking down the Cobb. He wants to walk back, but she wants to carry on and they agree to do as she desires. She asks what he and her father discussed last Thursday and he tells her ironically that they had a ‘small philosophical disagreement’ about Darwin. Her father clearly does not believe in his theories of evolution as Charles does.\nShe thinks that the greatest obstacle to their betrothal is that despite her father’s great wealth her grandfather was ‘only’ a draper whereas Charles’s ‘had been a baronet’. He reminds her he is a scientist and, therefore, is bound to disagree with her father and she points out to him that they have been walking on fossils.\nCharles notices the other figure on the Cobb and realizes it is a woman. Ernestina informs him it must be ‘poor Tragedy’ and that she has other nicknames. The fishermen call her ‘The French Lieutenant’s …Woman’. Ernestina also says this woman is ‘a little mad’ and she does not like to go near her. After Charles prompts her, she goes on to explain that there is a rumor that the woman did ‘worse’ than fall in love with the French lieutenant and she is now waiting for his return. She now works as ‘a servant of some kind’ for Mrs Poulteney. On Charles’s instigation, they walk closer to the woman and it is noted that she is wearing a man’s riding coat and appears to be oblivious to fashion. Charles makes conversation with her and when she turns to look at him he feels as though she looks straight through him. He thinks her face ‘is not the one expected of the age’, as there is ‘no artifice there, no hypocrisy, no hysteria, no mask’.\nAfterwards, Charles thinks repeatedly of the look she gave him. He compares it to a ‘lance’ and feels she has seen him as an ‘unjust enemy’. When Charles and Ernestina walk away from the woman, he tells her that he wishes she had not told him the ‘sordid facts’ as there is no mystery or romance about the woman now. Ernestina teases him for this as he is the scientist, ‘the despiser of novels’.\nAnalysis – Chapters One and Two\nThese first two chapters introduce the enigmatic French Lieutenant’s Woman and the readers recognize her difference from others immediately. She is isolated as she stands on the Cobb and rumors are passed around about her in the town, which Ernestina is willing to repeat, and which imply she is of loose morals in this era of obeying convention. She is also described as wearing a man’s coat and, unlike Ernestina, is oblivious to the rules of fashion.\nCharles has his interest piqued by this woman and is struck by her face as she refuses (or is unable) to wear the standard mask of hypocrisy. In these first two chapters alone, it is evident that the eponymous heroine is separate and different from the people of the town and is also lower in class than Charles and Ernestina. She embodies a challenge to conformity, in terms of her isolation, dress and supposed history, and continues to stand apart from the crowd.\nQuestion:\nSarah Woodruffe is the eponymous heroine of which classic 20th century novel?\nAnswer:\nThe French Lieutenants Women\nPassage:\nBAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role\nBest Actor in a Leading Role is a British Academy Film award presented annually by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) to recognize an actor who has delivered an outstanding leading performance in a film.\n\nSuperlatives\n\nNote: Dustin Hoffman's total of eight nominations, includes his 1968 Most Promising Newcomer nomination for The Graduate.\n\nWinners and nominees \n\nFrom 1952 to 1967, there were two Best Actor awards: one for a British actor and another for a foreign actor.

It has been widely recorded as a jazz standard.\n\nThe song is performed in the first act by Lieutenant Cable when he makes love to his adored Liat, to whom he was only recently introduced by her mother Bloody Mary. The song shows that love just happens and does not follow the rules of racial separation prevalent in the United States at that time.\n\nAndy Williams released a version of the song on his 1958 album, Andy Williams Sings Rodgers and Hammerstein.\n\nLyrical Analysis\n\nHammerstein used repetition as a key aspect of the song repeating the words \"am I\" and \"are you\" when describing Cable and Liat: \"softer than starlight\", \"gayer than laughter\" and \"younger than springtime\".\n\nMusical Analysis\n\nThe song is written in F Major.\nQuestion:\nThe song 'Younger than springtime' was featured in which musical?\nAnswer:\nThe South Pacific\nPassage:\nBognor or Bust\nBognor or Bust was a 2004 UK television panel game, on the subject of news and current affairs. Produced by 4DTV for ITV, the show conventionally gave contestants the opportunity to win prizes, yet was comedic in style. It combined members of the public and celebrities on the same panel.\n\nThe show was hosted by comic actor and presenter Angus Deayton. His hosting of this show was largely viewed as his next step after being ousted from Have I Got News for You. Designing the style of the show to be similar to that of HIGNFY may have been deliberate.\n\nBefore the game began, the two contestants picked two out of a group of four celebrities to play on their team. In Round 1, Deayton asked a series of questions on the week's news, to be answered on the buzzer. At the end of the round, there was a quick recap of the scores. For the End of Part 1, the viewers were shown a picture with something missing, and were asked to guess what it is during the commercial break. In Part 2, the missing object was revealed (to general amusement) and Round 2 commenced. The player in the lead chose one of two pictures that served as (not very good) cryptic clues to a certain category. The team then had to answer a succession of quick-fire questions within that category in a time limit. Afterwards, the process repeated with the other team and the other category. At the end of Round 2, the player with the most points proceeded to the final round.\n\nThe final round consisted of a single multiple choice question with two possible answers, on which the contestant can confer with all four celebrities. When answered correctly, the contestant was awarded a paid-for exotic holiday. (The question was based on a story taken from a newspaper from the country from the holiday's destination.) However, if the final question was answered incorrectly, the contestant was instead 'awarded' a trip to the seaside resort Bognor Regis in West Sussex, from which the name of the show was derived, and a randomly selected member of the audience won the exotic holiday. In the context of this show, Bognor was not seen as an upmarket resort and was therefore a satirical booby prize.\n\nDespite steady ratings of three to four million viewers, the series was not recommissioned following its original run.\nQuestion:\nWho was the host of the TV game show Bognor or Bust\nAnswer:\nAngus Deayton\nPassage:\nUsed Burns Usa Musical Instruments Product Values by ...\nUsed Burns Usa Musical Instruments Product Values   by UsedPrice.com\nElectric Guitar\n2005\nDescription: Body: Basswood (Tilia, Linden, Lime) - Neck Attachment: Bolt - Neck Wood: Maple - Neck Construction: 3 Piece - Fingerboard: Rosewood - Frets: 21 - Scale Length: 24.75\" (63cm) - Headstock: 3+3 - Cutaway: Double - Hardware: 1x Volume Control, 2x Tone Control - Pickups: Alnico Burns Rez-O-matik - Pickup Configuration: 3 - String Instrument Finish: Jet Black, Shadow White\nQuestion:\nWhat type of musical instrument is a Burns Bison?\nAnswer:\nSaddle (guitar)\nPassage:\nConnective tissue\nConnective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. It develops from the mesoderm. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue. Connective tissue is found in between other tissues everywhere in the body, including the nervous system. In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and  spinal cord are composed of connective tissue.\n\nAll connective tissue apart from blood and lymph consists of three main components: fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers),  ground substance and cells. (Not all authorities include blood  or lymph as connective tissue.) Blood and lymph lack the fiber component. All are immersed in the body water.\n\nThe cells of connective tissue include fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells and leucocytes.\n\nStructure\n\nConnective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper, and special connective tissue.  Connective tissue proper consists of loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into dense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.)  Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood.  Other kinds of connective tissues include fibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues.  New vascularised connective tissue that forms in the process of wound healing is termed granulation tissue. \nFibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT.\n\nType I collagen, is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up about 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body. \n\nCharacteristics\n\nCharacteristics of CT:\n* Cells are spread through an extracellular fluid. \n* Ground substance - A clear, colorless, and viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans to fix the body water and the collagen fibers in the intercellular spaces. Ground substance slows the spread of pathogens.\n* Fibers. Not all types of CT are fibrous. Examples of non-fibrous CT include adipose tissue and blood. Adipose tissue gives \"mechanical cushioning\" to the body, among other functions.   Although there is no dense collagen network in adipose tissue, groups of adipose cells are kept together by collagen fibers and collagen sheets in order to keep fat tissue under compression in place (for example, the sole of the foot). The matrix of blood is plasma. \n* Both the ground substance and proteins (fibers) create the matrix for CT.\n\nFunction\n\nConnective tissue has a wide variety of functions that depend on the types of cells and the different classes of fibers involved. Loose and dense irregular connective tissue, formed mainly by fibroblasts and collagen fibers, have an important role in providing a medium for oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from capillaries to cells, and carbon dioxide and waste substances to diffuse from cells back into circulation. They also allow organs to resist stretching and tearing forces. Dense regular connective tissue, which forms organized structures, is a major functional component of tendons, ligaments and aponeuroses, and is also found in highly specialized organs such as the cornea. Elastic fibers, made from elastin and fibrillin, also provide resistance to stretch forces. They are found in the walls of large blood vessels and in certain ligaments, particularly in the ligamenta flava.\n\nIn hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, reticular fibers made by reticular cells provide the stroma—or structural support—for the parenchyma—or functional part—of the organ.\n\nMesenchyme is a type of connective tissue found in developing organs of embryos that is capable of differentiation into all types of mature connective tissue. Another type of relatively undifferentiated connective tissue is mucous connective tissue, found inside the umbilical cord.\n\nVarious type of specialized tissues and cells are classified under the spectrum of connective tissue, and are as diverse as brown and white adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone. Cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, mast cells, plasma cells and eosinophils are found scattered in loose connective tissue, providing the ground for starting inflammatory and immune responses upon the detection of antigens.\n\nClinical significance\n\nIt is estimated that 1 in 10 people have a connective tissue disorder.  Diseases of connective tissue include:\n\n*Connective tissue neoplasms including sarcomas such as hemangiopericytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in nervous tissue.\n*Congenital diseases include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.\n*Myxomatous degeneration – a pathological weakening of connective tissue.\n*Mixed connective tissue disease – a disease of the autoimmune system, also undifferentiated connective tissue disease.\n*Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – a major autoimmune disease of connective tissue\n*Scurvy, caused by a deficiency of vitamin C which is necessary for the synthesis of collagen.\n\nStaining of connective tissue\n\nFor microscopic viewing, most of the connective tissue staining-techniques, color tissue fibers in contrasting shades. Collagen may be differentially stained by any of the following:\n\n* Van Gieson's stain\n* Masson's trichrome stain\n* Mallory's trichrome stain\n* Aniline blue stain\n* Eosin\n* Reticulin stain\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to the chord of strong fibrous tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone?\nAnswer:\nVagina fibrosa\nPassage:\nSteatopygia\nSteatopygia (; from the Greek στέαρ stéar, \"tallow\"  and πυγή pugḗ, \"rump\")  is the state of having substantial levels of tissue on the buttocks and thighs. This build is not confined to the gluteal regions, but extends to the outside and front of the thighs, and tapers to the knee producing a curvaceous figure.\n\nHistory\n\nSteatopygia is a genetic characteristic generally prevalent in women of African origin, most notably among though not limited to the Khoisan. In most populations of Homo sapiens, females are more likely than their male counterparts to accumulate adipose tissue in the buttock region. This genetic characteristic is prevalent among women but also occurs to a lesser degree in men. It has also been observed among the Pygmy people of Central Africa and the Onge tribe of the Andaman Islands. \n\nSteatopygia would seem to have been a characteristic of a population which once extended from the Gulf of Aden to the Cape of Good Hope, from which peoples the Khoisan and Pygmies may be remnants. Among the Khoisan, it begins in infancy and is fully developed by the time of the first pregnancy. While the Khoisan afford the most noticeable examples of its development, it is by no means rare in other parts of Africa.\n\nIt has been suggested that this feature was once more widespread. Paleolithic Venus figurines, sometimes referred to as \"Steatopygian Venus\" figures,  discovered from Europe to Asia presenting a remarkable development of the thighs, and even the prolongation of the labia minora, have been used to support this theory.  Whether these were intended to be lifelike or exaggeratory, even idealistic, is unknown. These figures do not qualify as Steatopygian, since they exhibit an angle of approximately 120 degrees between the back and the buttocks,  while Steatopygia is diagnosed by modern medical standards at an angle of about 90 degrees only.\n\nSaartjie Baartman is believed to have had this characteristic.\nQuestion:\nIn humans, steatopygia is a high degree of fat accumulation in and around which part of the body?\nAnswer:\nAsscheeks\nPassage:\nKnow about Joseph Jagger - Roulette Online Game\nKnow about Joseph Jagger\nMumbels\nJoseph Jagger\nThe full name of Jagger was Joseph Hobson Jagger and he was born in 1830 and died in 1892. Basically He was an engineer but he was popular for playing roulette. Some people believe that his name was Jaggers but most of the research showed that his name was Jagger not Jaggers. He had some type blood connection with Mick Jagger.\nHe was born in the September of 1830 and his village name Shelf and that village situated near the Halifax of Yorkshire. He worked in cotton industries of Yorkshire as an engineer and from that he got experience about machine.\nLink with Roulette\nHe did a lot research about roulette machines and its behavior and after that he discovered that roulette machines were not random as everybody said and it could have biases that could be turned for a particular slot or number and that number would win a lot. In the 1873 he hired 6 people to secretly record the winning positions of the 6 roulette wheels of 6 famous casinos of that time. After getting the records he came with a decision that for one roulette wheel among the 6 had clear bias, and that wheel made outcomes only for 29, 28, 22, 19, 18, 17, 9, 8 and 7 numbers, and other numbers happened only a few times in a day.\nAdventure Began\nAfter the decision, he made his 1st bet on the 7th July of 1875 and won a lot within a shortest period of time. He won Â£14,000 but comparing with amount of current time, that amount will be Â£700,000, 50 times larger than the actual amount. For the next 3 days he won Â£60,000 and after that the casino authority changed the wheel. He marked the wheel earlier and after a few rounds he learnt that the wheel was changed.\nThen he went to look for the mark and he found that wheel in other place of the casino. Then he started winning again and everyday the casino authority changing the position of the roulette wheel and at last they broke the wheel and for doing this Jagger loosed a lot but still he had most of his winnings in his hand. After a few days of loosing Jagger left Monte Carlo and he never came back to the city.\nJagger invested all his winnings in different businesses and he got a lot profit from those businesses. In 1892 a song come out with the name The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo and the man who was behind of this song was Jagger and people of the gambling world still uses his name to play and gamble.\nQuestion:\nWhat did Joseph Hobson Jagger 'break' in July 1875?\nAnswer:\nThe Bank at Monte Carlo\nPassage:\nJericho, Oxford\nJericho is an historic suburb of the English city of Oxford.  It consists of the streets bounded by the Oxford Canal, Worcester College, Walton Street and Walton Well Road. Located outside the old city wall, it was originally a place for travellers to rest if they had reached the city after the gates had closed. The name Jericho may have been adopted to signify this 'remote place' outside the wall. \n\nHistory\n\nThis was originally an industrial area which grew up because of its proximity to the Oxford Canal, which arrived in 1790. The Eagle Ironworks (now redeveloped into apartments), wharves and the Oxford University Press were based there and its residential streets are mostly 'two-up, two-down' Victorian workers' houses. With back streets of 19th century terraced housing and many restaurants, it has become a popular area for student and London commuter accommodation.\n\nMany reports from the 1870s suggest that early homes in Jericho were built with very poor drainage. Low-lying land and lack of basic drainage in these homes would result in flooding. Flooding, open sewers, and overcrowding resulted in deaths from diseases such as typhoid and dysentery, with five out of eleven typhoid deaths in 1873 originating from Jericho. \n\nIn the 1950s, Jericho was briefly a red light area, and in the early 1960s there were plans to demolish it and replace it with light industrial units and new housing. However, many people objected and campaigned to save this historic area, rallied by local city councillor Olive Gibbs and the Jericho Residents Association. As a result, the plans were changed. Those houses beyond repair were demolished, but many others were upgraded in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the help of council grants. This encouraged many young professionals and families to move in; and subsequently Jericho became one of Oxford's most sought-after areas. Large council and social housing developments were built in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nCommunity\n\nJericho retains a strong community spirit. The Jericho Community Association runs the Jericho Community Centre  in Canal Street, maintains the community website, Jericho Online,  publishes the local newspaper the Jericho Echo  and organizes the annual Jericho Street Fair which is held in mid-June each year, around the feast day of the patron saint Barnabas (11 June). It is also the focus for other community activities and has also been very active in campaigning for responsible development of the canal-side land behind St Barnabas Church, on a part of which it plans to build a new Community Centre.\nIt is served by a primary school, St Barnabas Primary School, a large primary school where over 50% speak English as a second language.\n\nAppropriately for its biblical name, Jericho is also known for its iconic places of worship. The Church of England parish church is the Anglo-Catholic St Barnabas Church,  next to the Oxford Canal. St Sepulchre's Cemetery lies off Walton Street, which has no associated church and has lost its chapel. The Albert Street Chapel   (Reformed Baptist) is also in the neighbourhood. The Oxford Synagogue (one of the few in England with more than one denomination of Judaism worshipping in the same house) and the Oxford Jewish Centre   are in Jericho.\n\nCastlemill Boatyard is a 160-year-old wharf on the canal in Jericho, previously owned by British Waterways and now closed. British Waterways sold the site to a company that subsequently went into administration. The land has yet to be marketed by the administrators. Since the closure of the yard, Jericho Community Boatyard Ltd has been set up to restore services for Oxford boaters and protect the future of Castle Mill Boatyard. \n\nThe local cinema has had a number of incarnations. It started in 1913 as the North Oxford Kinema.   In 1925, it was renamed The Scala. Then in 1970 it was split in two and became Studios 1 and 2, one of which was well known for showing softcore pornography. In 1977, the cinema revived again after being taken over by the London company Contemporary Entertainments and acquired its current name, the Phoenix, showing first-run and art house films.\n\nJericho in fiction\n\nThomas Hardy's novel Jude the Obscure has a scene set in St Barnabas Church, and it is possible that the suburb named 'Beersheba' in the novel is based on Jericho.  As an homage to Hardy, in 1996, one of Jericho's pubs was renamed Jude the Obscure.\n\nThe first episode of the long running ITV drama series Inspector Morse, starring British actor John Thaw, called \"The Dead of Jericho\", was partially filmed in the streets of Jericho, notably Combe Road (which is 'Canal Reach' in the drama). It also featured the exterior of the Bookbinders Arms public house on the corner of Victor Street. The spin-off show Lewis also has stories based around the same area.\n\nPhilip Pullman set parts of his novels Northern Lights and Lyra's Oxford in Jericho. In the books, Jericho is home to the water-dwelling \"Gyptians\". He has been a vocal advocate of the residential boaters' fight to save the Castlemill Boatyard. \n\nIn The Whore's Asylum by Katy Darby (Penguin Group, 2012), the \"home for indigent whores\" is in Victor Street and the young doctor attending their special medical needs lives in Canal Street. Jericho in 1887 is described (probably inaccurately) as \"haunted by drunkards, thieves,and the lowest sort of brazen female as ever lifted her petticoats\".\nQuestion:\nIn which British city is there a district called The Jericho?\nAnswer:\nOxford, england\nPassage:\nWhat is Google Street View? - Definition from WhatIs.com\nWhat is Google Street View? - Definition from WhatIs.com\npneumatics\nGoogle Street View is a feature of Google Maps that enables users to view and navigate through 360 degree horizontal and 290 degree vertical panoramic street level images of various cities around the world.

The vessel and her six-man crew had been fishing the North Atlantic Ocean out of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Her last reported position was 180 mi northeast of Sable Island on October 28, 1991. The story of Andrea Gail and her crew was the basis of the 1997 book The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger, and a 2000 film adaptation of the same name.\n\nF/V Andrea Gail\n\nAndrea Gail was a 72 ft commercial fishing vessel constructed in Panama City, Florida in 1978, and owned by Robert Brown. Her home port was Marblehead, Massachusetts. She also sailed from Gloucester, Massachusetts, where she would offload her catch and reload food, fuel, and stores for her next run. She was originally named Miss Penny.\n\nLost at sea\n\nFinal voyage\n\nAndrea Gail began her final voyage departing from Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1991, bound for the Grand Banks of Newfoundland off the coast of eastern Canada. After poor fishing, Captain Frank W. \"Billy\" Tyne Jr. headed east to the Flemish Cap where he believed they would have better luck. Despite weather reports warning of dangerous conditions, Tyne set course for home on October 26–27. It is known that the ship's ice machine was malfunctioning and unable to maintain the catch for much longer. \n\nDisappearance\n\nThe last reported transmission from Andrea Gail was at about 6:00 p.m. on October 28, 1991. Captain Tyne radioed Linda Greenlaw, Captain of the Hannah Boden, owned by the same company, and gave his coordinates as , or about 162 mi east of Sable Island. He also gave a weather report indicating 30 ft seas and wind gusts up to 80 knots (150 km/h). Tyne's final recorded words were \"She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong.\" Junger reported that the storm created waves in excess of 100 ft in height, but ocean buoy monitors recorded a peak wave height of 39 ft, and so waves of 100 ft were deemed \"unlikely\" by Science Daily.  However, data from a series of weather buoys in the general vicinity of the vessel's last known location recorded peak wave action exceeding 60 ft in height from October 28 through 30, 1991.\n\nSearch\n\nOn October 30, 1991, the vessel was reported overdue. An extensive air and sea search was launched by the 106th Rescue Wing from the New York Air National Guard, United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard forces. The search would eventually cover over 186000 sqnmi.\n\nOn November 6, 1991, Andrea Gail's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was discovered washed up on the shore of Sable Island. The EPIRB was designed to automatically send out a distress signal upon contact with sea water, but the Canadian Coast Guard personnel who found the beacon \"did not conclusively verify whether the control switch was in the on or off position\".  Authorities called off the search for the missing vessel on November 9, 1991, due to the low probability of crew survival.\n\nFuel drums, a fuel tank, the EPIRB, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam were the only wreckage ever found. The ship was presumed lost at sea somewhere along the continental shelf near Sable Island.\n\nCrew\n\nAll six of the crew were lost at sea.\n\n* Frank William \"Billy\" Tyne Jr. (Captain), aged 37 Gloucester, Massachusetts\n* Michael \"Bugsy\" Moran, aged 36 Bradenton Beach, Florida\n* Dale R. \"Murph\" Murphy, aged 30 Bradenton Beach, Florida\n* Alfred Pierre, aged 32 New York City\n* Robert F. \"Bobby\" Shatford, aged 30 Gloucester, Massachusetts\n* David \"Sully\" Sullivan, aged 28 New York City\n\nIn the media\n\n*The story of Andrea Gail and her crew inspired Sebastian Junger's 1997 book, The Perfect Storm, and a 2000 film of the same name, distributed by Warner Brothers.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nGoogle logo\nThe Google logo appears in numerous settings to identify the search engine company. Google has relied on several logos since its renaming (see History of Google), with the first logo created by Sergey Brin using GIMP. A revised logo debuted on September 1, 2015. The previous logo, with slight modifications between 1999 and 2013, was designed by Ruth Kedar; the wordmark was based on the Catull typeface, an old style serif typeface designed by Gustav Jaeger for the Berthold Type Foundry in 1982. \n\nThe company also includes various modifications or humorous features, such as cartoon modifications of their logo for use on holidays, birthdays of famous people, and major events, such as the Olympics.  These special logos, some designed by Dennis Hwang, have become known as Google Doodles.\n\nHistory \n\nIn 1998, Larry Page created a computerized version of the Google letters using the free graphics program GIMP. The typeface was changed and an exclamation mark was added mimicking the Yahoo! logo. \n\n\"There were a lot of different color iterations\", says Ruth Kedar, the graphic designer who developed the now-famous logo. \"We ended up with the primary colors, but instead of having the pattern go in order, we put a secondary color on the L, which brought back the idea that Google doesn't follow the rules.\" \n\nIn 2010, the Google logo received its first major overhaul since May 31, 1999. The new logo was first previewed on November 8, 2009,  and was officially launched on May 6, 2010.  It utilises an identical typeface to the previous logo, but the \"o\" is distinctly more orange-colored in place of the previously more yellowish \"o\", as well as a much more subtle shadow rendered in a different shading style. On October 25, 2013, Google introduced a new \"flat\" (two-dimensional) logo with a slightly altered color palette.   On May 24, 2014, the Google logo was updated, the second 'g' moved right one pixel and the 'l' moved down and right one pixel.   The old 2010 Google logo remained in use on some pages, such as the Google Doodles page, for a period of time. \n\nOn September 1, 2015, Google introduced a controversial \"new logo and identity family\" designed to work across multiple devices.    The notable difference in the logo is the change in the typeface. The colors remained the same; however, Google switched to a modern, geometric sans-serif typeface called Product Sans, created in-house at Google (and also used for the Alphabet logo). \n\n Google Doodles \n\nThe first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.   The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000.  Hwang has been designing the Google Doodles ever since.  \n\nColorless logo\n\nFrom time to time, Google shows a special colorless logo,  on a local homepage in recognition of a major tragedy, often for several days. The design was apparently first used on the Google Poland homepage following the air disaster that killed, among others, Polish President Lech Kaczyński in April 2010. A few days later, the logo was used in China and Hong Kong to pay respects to the victims of the Qinghai earthquake. \n\nOn September 8, 2010, the doodle once again changed to a greyed-out Google logo that lit up with the standard Google colors as the first 6 letters of a search query were entered. It goes by the name of the Keystroke Logo. \n\nFavicon\n\nGoogle's favicon from May 31, 1999 to May 29, 2008, was a blue, uppercase \"G\" on white background. It was accompanied by a border with a red, blue, and a green side.\n\nOn May 30, 2008, a new favicon was launched. It showed the lowercase \"g\" from Google's 1999 logo, colored in blue against a white background, and originally was intended to be a part of a larger set of icons developed for better scalability on mobile devices. \n\nA new favicon was launched on January 9, 2009. It included a left-aligned white \"g\" with background areas colored in red, green, blue and yellow, with the top, bottom, and left edges of the \"g\" cropped.   It was based on a design by André Resende, a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Campinas in Brazil. He submitted it for a contest launched by Google in June 2008 to receive favicon submissions. The official Google blog stated: \"His placement of a white 'g' on a color-blocked background was highly recognizable and attractive, while seeming to capture the essence of Google\".\n\nThe favicon used from August 13, 2012 to August 31, 2015, showed the small letter \"g\" in white, centered on a solid light blue background.\n\n, Google's favicon shows a capital letter \"G\", in the tailor-made font for the new logo, with segments colored red, yellow, green, and blue.\nQuestion:\nWhat colour are the ‘G’s’ in the regular Google logo?\nAnswer:\nBlue\nPassage:\nKingdom of Aragon\nThe Kingdom of Aragon (, , , ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories — the County of Barcelona and other Catalan Counties, the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece — that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nHistory \n\nIndependent kingdom \n\nAragon was originally a Carolingian feudal county around the city of Jaca, which in the first half of the 9th century became a vassal state of the kingdom of Pamplona (later Navarre), its own dynasty of counts ending without male heir in 922. The name Aragón is the same as that of the river Aragón, which flows by Jaca. It might derive from the Basque Aragona/Haragona meaning \"good upper valley\" (\"haran+goi+ona\", where \"haran\" valley, \"goi\"\n upper, high, and \"ona\"= good). Alternatively, the name may be derived from the earlier Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis.\n\nOn the death of Sancho III of Navarre in 1035, the Kingdom of Navarre was divided into three parts: (1) Pamplona and its hinterland along with western and coastal Basque districts, (2) Castile and (3) Sobrarbe, Ribagorza and Aragon. Sancho's son Gonzalo inherited Sobrarbe and Ribargorza, whereas his illegitimate son Ramiro received Aragon, but Gonzalo was killed soon after and all the land he owned went to his brother Ramiro, thus becoming the first de facto king of Aragon,  although he never used that title.\n\nBy defeating his brother, García Sánchez III of Navarre, Ramiro achieved independence for Aragon. His son Sancho Ramírez, who also inherited the kingdom of Navarre, was the first to call himself \"King of the Aragonians and Pamplonese\".  As the Aragonian domains expanded to the south, conquering land from Al Andalus, the capital city moved from Jaca to Huesca (1096), and later to Zaragoza (1118). After Alfonso the Battler died childless in 1135, different rulers were chosen for Navarre and Aragon, and the two kingdoms ceased to have the same ruler. By 1285 the southernmost areas of what is nowadays Aragon had been taken from the Moors.\n\nDynastic union with the County of Barcelona \n\nThe Kingdom of Aragón gave the name to the Crown of Aragon, after the dynastic union in 1150 of the Queen of Aragon (Petronilla of Aragon) with a Count of Barcelona (Ramon Berenguer IV), their son inheriting all different territories in the House of Aragon and the House of Barcelona. The Kings of Aragon had also the title of Count of Barcelona and ruled territories that consisted of not only the present administrative region of Aragon but also Catalonia, and later the kingdoms of Majorca, Valencia, Sicily, Naples and Sardinia. The King of Aragón was the direct King of the Aragonese region, and held also the title of Count of Provence, Count of Barcelona, Lord of Montpellier, and Duke of Athens and Neopatria. Each of these titles gave him sovereignty over a certain region, and these titles changed as he lost and won territories. In the 14th century, his power was greatly restricted by the Union of Aragon.\n\nThe Crown of Aragon became a part of the Spanish monarchy after the dynastic union with Castile, which supposed the de facto unification of both kingdoms under a common monarch. After this happened, Aragon kept its own institutions, such as the Corts, until the Nueva Planta decrees, promulgated between 1707 and 1715 in the aftermath of the War of the Spanish Succession, finally put an end to it.  The decrees ended the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia and Mallorca and the Principality of Catalonia, and merged them with Castile to officially form the Spanish kingdom.  A new Nueva Planta decree in 1711 restored some rights in Aragon, such as the Aragones Civil Right, but preserved the end of the political independence of the kingdom.\n\nFile:Reino d'Aragón en a Corona d'Aragón.svg|Location of Aragon in Crown of Aragon\nImage:Petronila Ramon Berenguer.jpg|Petronilla of Aragon, and Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona depicted later in a 16th-century painting.\nFile:Cortes de Aragón.jpg|Aljafería Palace\nQuestion:\nThe unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile laid the basis of which modern-day European country?\nAnswer:\nIslands of Spain\nPassage:\nMeibomian gland\nThe meibomian glands (or tarsal glands) are a special kind of sebaceous gland at the rim of the eyelids inside the tarsal plate, responsible for the supply of meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye's tear film. Meibum prevents tear spillage onto the cheek, trapping tears between the oiled edge and the eyeball, and makes the closed lids airtight.  There are approximately 50 glands on the upper eyelids and 25 glands on the lower eyelids.\n\nDysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also contribute to blepharitis.\n\nFunction\n\nMeibum\n\nLipids \n\nLipids are the major components of meibum (also known as \"meibomian gland secretions\"). The term \"meibum\" was originally introduced by Nicolaides et al. in 1981. \n\nThe biochemical composition of meibum is extremely complex and very different from that of sebum. Lipids are universally recognized as major components of human and animal meibum. Recently, an update on the composition of human meibum and on the structures of various positively identified meibomian lipids was published. \n\nCurrently, the most sensitive and informative approach to lipidomic analysis of meibum is mass spectrometry in combination with liquid chromatography.\n\nProteins\n\nIn humans, more than 90 different proteins have been identified in meibomian gland secretions. \n\nClinical significance\n\nDysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also contribute to blepharitis. Inflammation of the meibomian glands (also known as meibomitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, or posterior blepharitis) causes the glands to be obstructed by thick waxy secretions. Besides leading to dry eyes, the obstructions can be degraded by bacterial lipases, resulting in the formation of free fatty acids, which irritate the eyes and sometimes cause punctate keratopathy.\n\nMeibomian gland dysfunction is more often seen in women and is regarded as the main cause of dry eye disease.   Factors that contribute to meibomian gland dysfunction can include things such as a person's age and/or hormones.  Treatment can include warm compresses or expression of the gland by a professional. In some cases antibiotics or steroids are prescribed.\n\nHistory\n\nThe glands are named after Heinrich Meibom (1638–1700), a German physician.\nQuestion:\nProducing meibum, an oily sealant, where on the human head are the meibomian glands ?\nAnswer:\nEyelid diseases\nPassage:\nGerminal (French Republican Calendar)\nGerminal was the seventh month in the French Republican Calendar. The month was named after the Latin word germen, \"germination\". Germinal was the first month of the spring quarter (mois de printemps). It started March 21 or March 22, and ended April 19 or April 20. It follows Ventôse and precedes Floréal.\n\nIn the context of the French Revolution, Germinal sometimes refers to the downfall and execution of the Indulgents, Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins, which took place during Germinal of 1794, four months before the Thermidorian Reaction in which Robespierre himself was executed. The events of Germinal 1794 signaled the beginning of the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nDay name table \n\nLike all FRC months, Germinal lasted 30 days and was divided into three 10-day weeks called décades (decades). Every day had the name of an agricultural plant, except the 5th (Quintidi) and 10th day (Decadi) of every decade, which had the name of a domestic animal (Quintidi) or an agricultural tool (Decadi). The 26th and 27th changed their role in later years.\n\nConversion table\nQuestion:\nGerminal and Messidor are months in which calendar?\nAnswer:\nFrench Revolutionary Calendar\nPassage:\nHM Prison Full Sutton\nHM Prison Full Sutton is a Category A and B men's prison in the village of Full Sutton, near Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Full Sutton is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service and holds some 600 inmates. The prison's primary function is to hold, in conditions of high security, some of the most difficult and dangerous criminals in the country.\n\nThe Prison also has a unit known as the 'Close Supervision Centre', which is referred to as a \"Prison inside a Prison\". This is used to house prisoners, who are a high risk to the public and national security. HMP Full Sutton will not accept prisoners who have been sentenced to less than 4 years, or who have less than 12 months left to serve.\n\nHistory\n\nFull Sutton Prison opened in 1987, as a purpose-built maximum security prison for men. Over the years, it has held some of the most difficult, violent and dangerous criminals in the country.\n\nIn March 2000, the Home Office ordered an inquiry into Full Sutton after evidence emerged of racism among prison officers at the jail. The evidence centred on a log of an Asian inmate's phone conversations kept by two prison officers.  In January 2003, the prison was criticised again, when it emerged that inmates at Full Sutton were being paid as an incentive to learn to read and write. Payments of between £1 to £3 were being made to prisoners on successful completion of literacy and numeracy courses at the jail. \n\nIn December 2005, an report by the Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that gangs inside the prison were arranging \"fight clubs\" to pay off debts. The level of bullying and violence was so great that many wings were unsafe. There was evidence that gangs who had been operating on the streets continued to function inside the prison using intimidation. Security concerns had led to prisoners being denied access to outside sports. \n\nIn February 2006, the Independent Monitoring Board criticised Full Sutton for high levels of drug use amongst prisoners. The board stated that illegal drugs were an \"insidious disease\" inside the prison. \n\nOn 22 February 2011, the convicted murderer Colin Hatch, who was jailed for the murder of 7-year-old Sean Williams in 1993, was murdered in the prison. The killer was Damien Fowkes, an inmate who also attacked fellow child killer Ian Huntley, who survived. \n\nThe prison today\n\nThe healthcare centre at the prison has a six-bed ward, with an additional two safer cells and a crisis suite. The centre is staffed by a full-time Medical Officer. Full Sutton Prison provides a range of educational courses, from Basic Skills through to Open University degree courses. \n\nEmployment and training is also available in various prison workshops including bricklaying, painting and decorating, plumbing, recycling, textiles, contract services, Braille transcription, catering and industrial cleaning. The prison's gym also provides physical education with recognised qualifications, as well as recreational gym. There is a visitors' centre, with facilities including a baby changing area, a play area for children and refreshment machines. \n\nOn 26 May 2013, a prison warder was taken hostage. He and a female colleague were injured; other officers successfully dealt with the incident. \n\nNotable inmates\n\nFormer inmates\n\n* Freddie Foreman\n* Stefan Williams-Dennis \n* Donald Neilson\n* Sean O'Callaghan\n* Dale Cregan \n* Charles Bronson \n*Barry Horne \n\nCurrent inmates\n\n* Dennis Nilsen\n* Jeremy Bamber\n* John Cannan\n* Curtis \"Cocky\" Warren\nQuestion:\nIn which English town or City is Her Majesty's Prison Full Sutton?\nAnswer:\nPark Grove (1895)\nPassage:\nGlad All Over\n\"Glad All Over\" is a song written by Dave Clark and Mike Smith and recorded by The Dave Clark Five. In January 1964, it became the British group's first big hit, reaching No.1 on the UK Singles Chart.  In April 1964, it reached No.6 on the American U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the first British Invasion hit by a group other than The Beatles. It was also No.1 in Ireland, No.3 in Australia  and No.2 in Canada. It reached No.4 in the Netherlands  and No.16 in Germany.  \"Glad All Over\" was the No.2 selling single of 1964 in the U.K. (behind \"Can't Buy Me Love\" by The Beatles),  and also had sufficient UK sales in November and December 1963 to make it the 58th best-selling single of 1963;  put together these statistics suggest U.K. sales for \"Glad All Over\" of around 1,000,000 units by the end of 1964.\n\n\"Glad All Over\" featured Smith leading unison group vocals, often in call and response style, a saxophone line used not for solo decoration but underneath the whole song, and a big, \"air hammer\" beat that underpinned the wall of sound production known as the \"Tottenham Sound\".\n\nIn 1993, \"Glad All Over\" was reissued as a single in the UK, coupled with \"Good Old Rock ’n ’Roll\" and \"Having a Wild Weekend\". The reissue reached No.37 on the UK singles chart.\n\nUse by football and rugby teams and in adverts\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club adopted the song as their anthem in the 1960s. It is played at the start of all home games, and after full time (when Palace win). The chorus is played after home goals, before the goalscorer's name is read out. It is also sung by fans as a chant. On Saturday 10 February 1968 The Dave Clark Five played \"Glad All Over\" live at Crystal Palace's home, Selhurst Park. A cover version, sung by the squad at the time, was released as part of their FA Cup run (where they reached the final of the competition) in 1990. \n\nBlackpool have also used Glad All Over, played after a home goal is scored, since 2008, and other English Football League teams Rotherham United, Port Vale and Swindon Town have followed suit. It has also been used by Scottish Football League club Partick Thistle when they score a goal. Woking FC have played the song as part of their celebrations at score a goal. \n\nThe Welsh Rugby Football Club, Pontypridd, began using the song in 2004 to herald the points scored when converting a try, kicking a penalty or scoring a drop goal. This is in contrast to the Chumbawamba song \"Top of the World (Ole Ole Ole)\" used when Pontypridd score a try.\n\n, Wigan Warriors rugby league team have used it at the end of a home game at the DW Stadium if they have won.\n\nIrish team Shamrock Rovers use it as their anthem. BBC Radio Cambridge found this on the notes accompanying the song on their database.\n\nCovers\n\nSuzi Quatro recorded it on her Rock Hard album in 1980 (second track on the album).  It was also the second single from the album and reached chart positions in Scandinavia and Germany (peaking as number 70 on chart 100).\n\nIt was released as a single by Australian band Hush in 1975 and reached number 8 on the Australian singles chart. It was also included on their 1975 album \"Rough Tough 'N' Ready\".\n\nIt was covered by The Rezillos on their debut album Can't Stand the Rezillos.\nQuestion:\nWho were 'Glad All Over' in their No. 1 hit of 1965?\nAnswer:\nDAVE CLARK FIVE\nPassage:\nAngolan kwanza\nThe kwanza (sign: Kz; ISO 4217 code: AOA) is the currency of Angola. Four different currencies using the name kwanza have circulated since 1977.\n\nOverview\n\nFirst Kwanza, AOK, 1975-1990\n\nKwanza was introduced following Angolan independence. It replaced the escudo at par and was subdivided into 100 lwei. Its ISO 4217 code was AOK.\n\nCoins\n\nThe first coins issued for the kwanza currency did not bear any date of issue, although all bore the date of independence, \"11 de Novembro de 1975\". They were in denominations of 50 lwei, 1, 2, 5 and 10 kwanzas. 20 kwanza coins were added in 1978. The last date to appear on these coins was 1979.\n\nBanknotes\n\nOn 8 January 1977, banknotes dated 11 DE NOVEMBRO DE 1975 were introduced by the Banco Nacional de Angola (National Bank of Angola) in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 kwanzas.  The 20 kwanza note was replaced by a coin in 1978.\n\nNovo kwanza, AON, 1990-1995\n\nIn 1990, the novo kwanza was introduced, with the ISO 4217 code AON. Although it replaced the kwanza at par, Angolans could only exchange 5% of all old notes for new ones; they had to exchange the rest for government securities. This kwanza suffered from high inflation.\n\nBanknotes\n\nThis currency was only issued in note form. The first banknotes issued in 1990 were overprints on earlier notes in denominations of 50 (report not confirmed), 500, 1000 and 5000 novos kwanzas (5000 novos kwanzas overprinted on 100 kwanzas). In 1991, the word novo was dropped from the issue of regular banknotes for 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 and 500,000 kwanzas.\n\nKwanza reajustado, AOR, 1995-1999\n\nIn 1995, the kwanza reajustado replaced the previous kwanza at a rate of 1,000 to 1. It had the ISO 4217 code AOR. The inflation continued and no coins were issued.\n\nBanknotes\n\nDespite the exchange rate, such was the low value of the old kwanza that the smallest denomination of banknote issued was 1000 kwanza reajustado. Other notes were 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 kwanzas.\n\nSecond kwanza, AOA, 1999-\n\nIn 1999, a second currency was introduced simply called the kwanza. It replaced the kwanza reajustado at a rate of 1,000,000 to 1. Unlike the first kwanza, this currency is subdivided into 100 cêntimos. The introduction of this currency saw the reintroduction of coins. Although it suffered early on from high inflation, its value has now stabilized.\n\nCoins\n\nCoins in 10 and 50 cêntimo denominations are no longer used, as the values are minuscule.\n\nDuring 2012-14, new coins were introduced in denominations of 50 cêntimos, 1, 5, 10 and 20 kwanzas.\n\nBanknotes\n\nThe banknotes are quite similar in design, with only different colours separating them.\n\nThe Banco National de Angola issued a new series of kwanza banknotes on March 22, 2013 in denominations of 50, 100, 200 and 500 kwanzas. The other denominations (1000, 2000 and 5000 kwanzas) were issued on May 31, 2013.  \n\nHistorical exchange rates\n\nThis table shows the historical value of one U.S. dollar in Angola kwanzas:\n\nOn several occasions during the 1990s, Angola's currency was the least valued currency unit in the world.\n\nProduction\n\nThe Angolan kwanza banknotes have been produced by De La Rue in England.\nQuestion:\nWhich African country has the Kwanza as its currency?\nAnswer:\nAngola\nPassage:\nHeart Gloucestershire\nHeart Gloucestershire (formerly Severn Sound) is a local radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Heart network. It broadcasts to Gloucestershire from studios in Gloucester. \n\nThe transmitter is at Churchdown Hill, just west of the M5; the same transmitter as Radio Gloucestershire.\n\nHistory\n\nSevern Sound started transmissions on 23 October 1980, from its first studio at the \"Old Talbot Pub\" in Southgate Street, Gloucester.  The pub had been bought by local businessmen including Clive Lindley (Chairman of the Roadchef motorway service stations and Chairman of Severn Sound).  The station's first employee was Chief Engineer Quentin Howard who converted the pub into the radio station. \n\nThe original presenters were Alan Roberts (Head of Music) on Breakfast, Christopher Musk on mid-mornings, Eddie Vickers (Programme Controller) on the Lunchtime News and Topical programme, Laura de Vere on the Afternoon Show and Steve Ellis on Drivetime.  There used to be a Sunday lunch show where the presenter would go to various areas of Gloucester and share Sunday lunch with the residents of that house.  Jerry Thomas, top Gloucester Comedian, used to host the show, with Christopher Musk.\n\nOne, notable, director was the writer Dennis Potter, who played an active role in the station's early years and lived in Ross on Wye. Potter's Pennies from Heaven producer, Kenith Trodd, presented a Sunday programme of 78 records featuring singers such as Al Bowlly, which Todd and Potter had used in Pennies from Heaven. Another Director was England rugby player, Mike Burton, who also started Gulliver's Travels, a sports travel agency.  \n\nIn 1983, two of the station's engineers were killed on an outside broadcast. The pneumatic mast of their radio car touched an overhead 11kV power line, whilst they were preparing for a live broadcast from Soudeley Castle, Winchcombe. The inquiry into the accident found Severn Sound guilty of Health and Safety offences and fined the company £2,500. Many new safety procedures for radio cars were introduced across the whole industry as a result of the accident. \n\nThe station was sold to the Chiltern Radio Group, after some resistance, in 1989 and was later taken over by the GWR group in 1995. GCap Media was sold to Global Radio in 2008.\n\nDuring the Gloucester/Tewkesbury flood crisis of Summer 2007, Severn Sound was forced to move, temporarily, to the GWR FM Bristol Studios, due to a loss of electricity and running water. \n\nSplit frequencies\n\nIn 1990, Severn Sound split frequencies, with its 774 kHz AM frequency being renamed Three Counties Radio, expanding to cover Hereford & Worcester. This was an \"oldies\" station and was a mix of local programmes and networking from Chiltern Radio Network's Supergold service. Presenters who moved from Severn Sound to Three Counties included Tony Peters & Sally Low Hurry. John Hellings was brought in as breakfast presenter. In 1992, Three Counties Radio was re-branded as Severn Sound Supergold (it also stopped being promoted in Hereford & Worcester) and was re-branded again, in 1996, by new owners GWR as Severn Sound Classic Gold. Ownership rules meant that GWR had to sell all their Classic Gold licences to UBC Media and another re-brand to Classic Gold 774 followed. Today, the heritage name \"Severn\" is no longer mentioned on 774 AM after it was re-branded again, in 2007, to Gold, and again on 24 March 2014 to Smooth Radio, all programming on 774 AM now comes from London.\n\nRebrand\n\nIn September 2008, it was announced that Severn Sound would become Heart Gloucestershire as part of a national re-branding exercise by owners Global Radio, which has seen twenty-nine stations renamed as Heart Radio. \n\nThe new Heart Gloucestershire branding was launched at 6am on Monday 23 March 2009 with local programming broadcast from the above-the-street Bridge Studios, part of the Eastgate Shopping Centre (The Mall) in Gloucester. Local news bulletins on the station are now produced by Heart West Country in Bristol, following the closure of its Gloucester newsroom during the summer of 2010.\n\nProgramming\n\nLocal programming is produced and broadcast from Heart's Gloucester studios from 6-10am and 4-7pm on weekdays, 1-5pm on Saturdays and 12pm-4pm on Sundays. All networked programming originates from Global Radio's London headquarters, including the syndicated Vodafone Big Top 40 on Sunday afternoons.\n\nThe station's local presenters include Warren Moore (Heart Breakfast) and Justin Walker (weekday drivetime).\n\nHeart News\n\nHeart Gloucestershire broadcasts hourly local news bulletins from 6am-7pm on weekdays and 6am-12pm at weekends, produced by the Heart West Country news team based in Bristol, which also produces the news service for Heart Wiltshire.\n\nNational news updates air hourly from Global's London headquarters at all other times.\nQuestion:\nIn which west of England city is 'Severn Sound FM' radio station located?\nAnswer:\nGloucester, England\nPassage:\nWinslow High School (Maine)\nWinslow High School is a four year public high school located in Winslow, Maine.

He also worked in the Solarium. While there, Lowe played trombone in a seven-piece dance band called One Under the Eight, that played old-time favourites like \"Hello Dolly\", \"La Bamba\" and \"Moon River\".  Lowe's grandfather had been a trombonist and was a member of comedy jazz troupe The Nitwits. Lowe also became a skilled pianist.\n\nEducation\n\nLowe studied architecture at the University of Liverpool from 1978 but never fully graduated as he stated various times on television appearances and the Life in Pop documentary due to the formation of the Pet Shop Boys. During a work placement in 1981 at a London architectural practice, he designed a staircase for an industrial estate in Milton Keynes. It was at this time that he met Neil Tennant in a hi-fi shop on the Kings Road in London.\n\nPet Shop Boys\n\nSolo Appearances\n\nIn 1995, Lowe had a cameo in the Australian soap opera Neighbours.  His appearance was filmed whilst Pet Shop Boys were touring Australia.\n\nIn 1997, his flat was the subject of an in-depth feature in Elle Decoration magazine.\n\nIn 1993 he wrote and produced the track \"Do the Right Thing\" for the footballer Ian Wright (Lowe is a die-hard Arsenal F.C. fan).  The song featured backing vocals by the long-time Pet Shop Boys’ backing singer, Sylvia Mason-James, and the single featured remixes by Rollo. \n\nIn 2004, Lowe was commissioned to do music for an advertisement for the sunscreen brand Blockhead. The song ended up in a remixed version on a \"Café Mambo\" chill-out compilation. \n\nHe has also written the music for the song \"Streets of Berlin\", featured in the revival of Bent at the Trafalgar Studios in Whitehall in 2006.\n\nIn 2011, Lowe appeared as featured vocalist on Stop Modernists's cover version of the New Order song \"Subculture\". This was the first time Lowe had appeared as vocals on a non-Pet Shop Boys' project. \n\nPublic appearance\n\nLowe is well-known for his understated public presence, often wearing sportswear and with his eyes invisible behind sunglasses. In Pet Shop Boys videos and photoshoots he is often seen looking on as a spectator standing slightly behind Tennant. In live performances he rarely interacts with the audience and often stands still while playing keyboards.  In 1995, The Guardian commented that he was \"possibly more famous for not doing anything than almost anyone else in the history of popular entertainment.\" \n\nA Guardian profile of the group from 1993 noted that Lowe's image of \"silent Chris walking two steps behind singing Neil\" was an intentional choice, developed in discussion with photographer and music video director Eric Watson; Watson has commented that \"Chris didn't want to be seen playing keyboards or anything. We realised there was something about somebody singing and somebody else doing nothing – just looking, then looking away – that adds a hideous tension.\"\nQuestion:\nWho are Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant\nAnswer:\nWatapalava\nPassage:\nAlloway\nAlloway (Gaelic Allmhaigh, pronounced) is a former Scottish village that is now a suburb of Ayr. It is best known as the birthplace of Robert Burns and the setting for his poem \"Tam o' Shanter\". Tobias Bachope, the mason responsible for the construction of Hopetoun House, Craigiehall, and Kinross House, also hailed from Alloway. \n\nThe former village and surrounding area was incorporated into the former Royal Burgh of Ayr in 1935, and the extended village is now a suburb of Ayr on the River Doon.\n\nRobert Burns\n\nThe birthplace of Robert Burns, known as \"Burns Cottage\", is located in Alloway, now adjacent to a museum containing original manuscripts of his poetry. A nineteenth century memorial to Burns, designed by Thomas Hamilton, is located at the foot of the village next to the present church.\n\nThe nearby, ruined Alloway Auld Kirk and the old bridge over the River Doon (Brig o' Doon) are featured in the poem \"Tam O'Shanter\", and are presently tourist attractions. Burns's father, William Burnes, is buried in the Auld Kirk. To add a \"ghostly\" appearance to the place, green lights are illuminated over it at night.\n\nThe whole site relating to Burns, encompassing Burns Cottage, the Brig o' Doon, Alloway Auld Kirk, the old and new Museum buildings, the Burns Monument and relevant local landmarks, is maintained by the National Trust for Scotland as the [http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk Robert Burns Birthplace Museum].\n\nPublic parks\n\nThere are two main parks in Alloway. The first, Rozelle, hosts the Ayr Flower Show each summer and has an art gallery which holds various exhibitions throughout the year. Rozelle also maintains a permanent sculpture collection, including a Henry Moore and a series of granite carvings by Ronald Rae.  The second, Belleisle Park, houses two golf courses, walled garden, Camelia House, and a playground.\n\nAlloway has a primary school, library, post office, general store, church, pharmacy, tearoom and gift shop.\n\nSport\n\nCambusdoon New Ground is located in Alloway on the former Robertson's Field, and has hosted a number of Scotland Cricket Internationals. It is also the home of the Ayr Cricket Club, founded in 1859. Ayr Cricket Club has been at Cambusdoon since 1996, when they moved across the road from the original Cambusdoon ground. Ayr Cricket Club moved from the Dam Park to the original Cambusdoon ground in 1935; it remained their home for 60 years until it was sold for housing in 1995. The original cricket ground, which hosted two first-class matches (Scotland vs. Ireland in 1958 and 1974), was developed on the grounds of the former Cambusdoon Estate, once owned by 19th Century Iron and Coal magnate James Baird. Baird's original Cambusdoon House, now a ruin, was converted to a boys' preparatory school in the late 1920s, and the rest of the estate surrounding the cricket ground was developed for housing in the late 1930s. Former England cricket captain Mike Denness grew up in one of the houses on Shanter Way, which adjoined the cricket ground.\n\nAyr Hockey Club also play out of the Cambusdoon ground, on a purpose-built floodlit astroturf pitch, which is also used for 5-a-side and 11-a-side football. There is also a bowling green, with the Cricket Club, Hockey Club and Bowling Club being held under the Cambusdoon Sports Club title.\n\nMillbrae, the home of Ayr Rugby Club since 1964, is also located in Alloway.\n\nNearby\n\nNewark Estate is a pheasant and partridge game shooting estate immediately to the south of Alloway. It has been owned by the Walker family for at least three generations, their family grave being prominent in the churchyard of Alloway Parish Church.\nQuestion:\nWho is commemorated by a museum at Alloway, Strathclyde?\nAnswer:\nRabbie Burns\nPassage:\nUnderstanding old British money - pounds, shillings and pence\nUnderstanding old British money - pounds, shillings and pence\nBefore decimalization on 15 February 1971, there were twenty (20) shillings per pound.\nThe shilling was subdivided into twelve (12) pennies.\nThe penny was further sub-divided into two halfpennies or four farthings (quarter pennies).\n2 farthings = 1 halfpenny\n2 halfpence = 1 penny (1d)\n3 pence = 1 thruppence (3d)\n6 pence = 1 sixpence (a 'tanner') (6d)\n12 pence = 1 shilling (a bob) (1s)\n2 shillings = 1 florin ( a 'two bob bit') (2s)\n2 shillings and 6 pence = 1 half crown (2s 6d)\n5 shillings = 1 Crown (5s)\nDid you know\nThe pre-decimalisation British system of coinage was introduced by King Henry II. It was based on the troy system of weighing precious metals. The penny was literally one pennyweight of silver. A pound sterling thus weighed 240 pennyweights, or a pound of sterling silver.\nSymbols\nThe symbols 's' for shilling and 'd' for pence derive from the Latin solidus and denarius used in the Middle Ages.\nThe '£' sign developed from the 'l' for libra.\n£ or l in some documents\n= pound\nA £1 coin was called a Sovereign and was made of gold.\nA paper pound often was called a quid.\nMore than a pound (£)\n1 guinea and a £5.0.0 note\n1 guinea = £1-1s-0d ( £1/1/- ) = one pound and one shilling = 21 shillings or 21/- (which is £1.05 in todays money)\n1 guinea could be written as '1g' or '1gn'.\nA guinea was considered a more gentlemanly amount than £1. You paid tradesmen, such as a carpenter, in pounds but gentlemen, such as an artist, in guineas.\nA third of a guinea equalled exactly seven shillings.\nWhy guinea?\nBecause the Guinea coast was fabled for its gold, and its name became attached to other things like guinea fowl, and New Guinea.\n\"A Guinea coin was available as legal tender and they were minted from gold. Therefore ceased to be used as such as they became collectors items, for the gold presumably. I was given 4 gold guinea coins when I was 13.\"\nManuel, Wilmslow, Cheshire\n\"I remember the £5.0.0 note. It was larger than other notes, stiff and very white with black lettering.

It lies ten miles west of Cambridge and six miles south of Huntingdon, having along its centre Ermine Street, the old North Road, the Roman highway that for centuries served as a major artery from London to York, which is now the A1198. A bypass now means that most traffic can avoid Ermine Street, and it is comprehensively traffic-calmed.\n\nToday, Papworth Everard is a large village with a thriving community, home to substantial light industry and local business. It is also the centre for the Papworth Trust, a charity which offers housing and training to the disabled, and Papworth Hospital, renowned in the field of cardiology.\n\nHistory\n\nRecent archaeological work in the area of the Papworth Business Park has shown that there was some Bronze Age activity in the area.  But by the Roman period, when Ermine Street was built in the first century AD, it is unlikely that there was as yet anything we would now recognise as a village there. However the same archaeological work shows signs of Romano-British activity, as well as the road, in the area.  Roman rule collapsed in Britain in 410 AD. It was at least another two or three centuries before a Saxon leader, probably called 'Papa', established a small settlement about a quarter of a mile to the west of Ermine Street around the site of the present parish church. Indeed Papworth means \"the enclosure of Papa's people\": they were also involved in establishing Papworth St Agnes and Papley Grove.  Following the Norman conquest of 1066 the village and land of Papworth were granted by the new king to a Norman knight, Everard De Beche, from whose name the second element of the village's name is derived.   A moated area in the village is the remains of his castle.\n\nSport and recreation\n\nPapworth Everard has a King George's Field in memorial to King George V. Adjacent to the playing fields are a bowling green (currently in the process of renovation) and a series of all-weather, floodlit tennis courts. The village also has an open-air paddling pool in its park.\n\nPapworth Blasters\n\nPapworth Blasters is the village's local Association football team. They play their Home games at King George's Field. They have varying age ranges of teams from under 8s to under 16s and a men's team.\n\nLocal facilities & services\n\nPapworth Everard is served by a variety of local services, primarily based in the central location of Pendrill Court, between Chequers Lane and Ermine Street. This area is adjacent to the playing fields and so provides a central hub for the village. In addition to a combined pharmacy and doctors' surgery (on Chequers Lane) the village centre contains a convenience store incorporating a Post Office, a veterinary surgery, a coffee shop, a unisex hair salon, a chip shop, a library, Norfolk Street Deli and a family run party business, Bluebird Parties. The Village Hall was re-opened in 2015, under the control of the Parish Council.\n\nPlans remain to develop the old print works in the village into a micro-brewery and bakery but at present these remain hopeful.  The re-developed social club (formerly The Conservatory) opened as Rocky's Bar and Restaurant in August 2015.\n\nLocal news and information is published monthly in Papworth News & Views.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Papworth Everard shield.jpg\nImage:Papworth everard11.jpg\nImage:Papworth Everard3.jpg\nImage:Papworth 32.jpg\nImage:Papworth hospital.jpg|Papworth Hospital\nImage:Papworth Kebab Van.jpg|Kebab van\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nPapworth is in which county ?\nAnswer:\nCambridgeshire county council\nPassage:\nMiss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby\nMiss Abitha Tibbs and Miss Ursula Gatsby are fictional characters, played by Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts respectively, in the BBC television sitcom Fawlty Towers.\n\nMiss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby are two mostly inseparable and slightly scatty elderly spinsters who are permanent residents of Fawlty Towers (the only other long-term guest being Major Gowen). Basil Fawlty switches from being overly kind to being utterly rude during his various conversations with them, although they rarely understand his sarcasm. They are depicted as being \"on the edge of their eighties\". \n\nThe two ladies appear in every episode of the series, though are uncredited in \"A Touch of Class\" (the pilot). They seldom have main roles in the plot, usually being background characters adding to the atmosphere. Miss Tibbs plays a larger role in the episode \"The Kipper and the Corpse\", the only time she is seen away from Miss Gatsby, where she is repeatedly startled by a guest's corpse, which Basil, Manuel and Polly are desperately trying to keep hidden from guests until the undertaker arrives. Her unfortunate encounters with the deceased include being knocked unconscious by Polly, being locked in a cupboard with Leeman and fainting in horror after stumbling across the body in the hotel office. In that episode it is revealed that Tibbs is 79.\nQuestion:\nIn which TV establishment were Miss Gatsby and Miss 'Tibbs residents?\nAnswer:\nPolly Shearman\nPassage:\nPianist\nA pianist ( , ) is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ.\n\nPianists past and present\n\nModern classical pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching as well as learning new works/expanding their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and chamber music while others (relatively few) will perform as full-time piano soloists.\n\nClassical \n\nMozart could be considered the first \"concert pianist\" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers Beethoven and Clementi from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  Liszt, Brahms, Chopin, Mendelssohn and Rachmaninoff. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and Hans von Bülow. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.\n\nJazz \n\nJazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is freer than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known Jazz pianists include Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson and Herbie Hancock.\n\nPopular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include Victor Borge who performed as a comedian; Richard Clayderman, who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer Liberace, who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world.\n\nWell known pianists\n\nA single listing of pianists in all genres would be impractical, given the multitude of musicians noted for their performances on the instrument.  Below are links to lists of well-known or influential pianists divided by genres:\n\nClassical pianists\n\n*List of classical pianists (recorded)\n*List of classical pianists\n*List of classical piano duos (performers)\n\nJazz pianists\n\n*List of jazz pianists\n\nPop and rock music pianists\n\n*List of pop and rock pianists\n\nBlues pianists\n\n*List of blues musicians\n*List of boogie woogie musicians\n\nGospel pianists\n\n*List of gospel musicians\n\nNew-age pianists\n\n*List of new-age music artists\n\nPianists-composers\n\nMany important composers were also virtuoso pianists. The following is an incomplete list of such musicians.\n\nClassical period\n\n*Franz Schubert\n*Ludwig van Beethoven\n*Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n*Johann Nepomuk Hummel\n*Muzio Clementi\n*Carl Maria von Weber\n*Malek Jandali\n\nRomantic period\n\n*Edvard Grieg\n*Franz Liszt\n*Frédéric Chopin\n*Felix Mendelssohn\n*Johannes Brahms\n*Sergei Rachmaninoff\n*Anton Rubinstein\n*Camille Saint-Saëns\n*Isaac Albéniz\n*Nikolai Medtner\n*Charles-Valentin Alkan\n*Anton Arensky\n\nModern period\n\n*Béla Bartók\n*George Gershwin\n*Mikhail Pletnev\n*Sergei Prokofiev\n*Dmitri Shostakovich\n\nAmateur pianists\n\nSome people, having received a solid piano training in their youth, decide not to continue their musical careers but choose nonmusical ones. As a result, there are prominent communities of amateur pianists all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts just because of their love to music, but not to earn money.  The International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs, held annually in Paris, attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio. It is also a notable fact that Jon Nakamatsu, the Gold Medal winner of the prestigious Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for professional pianists in Fort Worth, Texas (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or major in music, and worked as a high school German teacher then. It was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.\n\nThe German pianist Davide Martello is known for travelling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst]\nQuestion:\nWhich composer and pianist, usually included as one of the Three B's of classical music, wrote A German Requiem ?\nAnswer:\nBrahm's\nPassage:\nDuet\nA duet is a musical composition for two performers in which the performers have equal importance to the piece. It is often used to describe a composition involving two singers. It differs from a harmony, as the performers take turns performing a solo section rather than performing simultaneously. In classical music, the term is most often used for a composition for two singers or pianists. A piece performed by two pianists performing together on the same piano is referred to as \"piano duet\" or \"piano four hands\".  A piece for two pianists performing together on separate pianos is referred to as a \"piano duo\".\n\n\"Duet\" is also used as a verb for the act of performing a musical duet, or colloquially as a noun to refer to the performers of a duet. The word is also occasionally used in reference to non-musical activities performed together by two people.\n\nA musical ensemble with more than two solo instruments or voices is called trio, quartet, quintet, sextet, septet, octet, etc. \n\nHistory \n\nWhen Mozart was young, he and his sister Marianne played a duet of his composition at a London concert in 1765. The four-hand, described as a duet, was in many of his compositions which included five sonatas; a set of variations, two performers and one instrument, and a sonata for two pianos. The first published sonata or duet was in 1777. \n\nIn Renaissance music, a duet specifically intended as a teaching tool, to be performed by teacher and student, was called a bicinium (see Étude).\n\nIn opera \n\nDuets have always been a part of the structure of operas. Early 16th-century operas such as L'Orfeo and L'incoronazione di Poppea involve duets throughout the performance. In 17th-century Italy duets were often used in comic scenes within serious operas. In Baroque France the duet was popular in tragedies, such as songs of vengeance and confrontation. The love duet was characterized by singing in close harmonies of 3rds and 6ths, symbolizing unity after conflict. \n\nFamous operatic duets \n\n* La clemenza di Tito by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n* La Cenerentola by Gioachino Rossini\n* The Puritans of Vincenzo Bellini\n* Don Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti\n* La traviata by Giuseppe Verdi\n* Aida of Giuseppe Verdi\n* Mefistofele of Arrigo Boito\n* Manon Lescaut by Giacomo Puccini\n*Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini\n* L'amico Fritz by Pietro Mascagni\n\nIn pop music \n\nThroughout the 20th century duets have been common in the popular music of the era. Some songs were written to be heard as conversations, such as \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\". Others were performed around a theme, for example New York in \"Empire State of Mind\". Occasionally duets are an improvisation between artists, such as \"Under Pressure\". David Bowie and Freddie Mercury reportedly composed the lyrics in a day by improvising together. \n\nFamous pop duets \n\n* \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" - Ricardo Montalbán and Esther Williams, and with roles reversed, Red Skelton and Betty Garrett, 1948\n* \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" – Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, 1950\n* \"I Got You Babe\" – Sonny & Cher, 1965\n* \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" – Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, 1967\n* \"Jackson\" – Johnny Cash and June Carter, 1967\n* \"Somethin' Stupid\" – Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra, 1967\n* \"Waters of March\" – Elis Regina and Antonio Carlos Jobim, 1972\n* \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" – Elton John and Kiki Dee, 1976\n* \"You're The One That I Want\" – John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, 1978\n* \"Dead Ringer for Love\" – Meat Loaf and Cher, 1981\n* \"Endless Love\" – Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, 1981\n* \"Under Pressure\" – Queen and David Bowie, 1981\n* \"Ebony and Ivory\" – Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder, 1982\n* \"Islands in the Stream\" – Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, 1983\n* \"Don't Give Up\" – Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel, 1985\n* \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" – Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, 1987\n* \"Scream/Childhood\" – Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson, 1995\n* \"Tell Him\" – Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion, 1997\n* \"When You Believe\" – Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, 1998\n* \"Where You Are\" – Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, 2000\n* \"Beautiful Liar\" – Beyoncé and Shakira, 2007\n* \"No Estamos Solos\" – Eros Ramazzotti and Ricky Martin, 2007\n* \"Ta Voix (The Calling)\" – Jennifer Paige and Lââm, 2008\n* \"Empire State of Mind\" – Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, 2009\n* \"Limpido\" – Laura Pausini and Kylie Minogue, 2013\n* \"Hurt You\" – Toni Braxton and Babyface, 2014\nQuestion:\nWho duetted with Kenny Rogers on Islands In The Stream\nAnswer:\nFloyd Parton\nPassage:\nDipsomania\nDipsomania is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for alcohol. In the 19th century, dipsomania was a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as alcoholism. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek dipso (\"δίψα\"= thirst) and mania. It is still mentioned in the WHO ICD10 as an alternative description for alcohol dependence syndrome, episodic use F10.26\n\nHistory\n\nThe term was coined by the German physician C. W. Hufeland in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Brühl-Cramer,  he translated Brühl-Cramer's term \"trunksucht\" as \"dipsomania\".[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY1&SRETRY\n0 The history of alcoholism: Brühl-Cramer's concepts and observations - KIELHORN - 2006 - Addiction - Wiley Online Library]\n   Brühl-Cramer classified dipsomania in terms of continuous, remittent, intermittent, periodic and mixed forms, and in his book he discussed its etiology, pathogenesis, sequelae, and treatment options, all influenced by prevailing ideas about the laws of chemistry and concepts of excitability. \n\nDue to the influence of Brühl-Cramer's pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century.  Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as \"the most medical\" of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century.  Along with terms such as \"inebriety\", the idea of dipsomania was used as part of an effort of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease.  As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this dipsomania reform movement, it \"illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century.\"\n\nAlthough dipsomania was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness.   In his 1893 book Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania, Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available. Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.\n\nOver time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcoholism. \n\nExamples in fiction\n\n* Whip Whitaker, in the 2012 film Flight, is a dipsomaniac airline pilot who flies by instinct, even when drunk.  \n* Ben Sanderson, a character played by Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas \n* Sebastian Flyte, a character from the novel Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh, who sarcastically describes himself as a dipsomaniac\n* Captain Archibald Haddock, a good friend of Tintin\n* Ramakant Malhotra, a stock character in Surender Mohan Pathak's novels\n* James O. Incandenza, a character in Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, described in the novel as having \"crippling dipsomania\"\n* Dwight Carson, a talented writer in The Fountainhead, who is turned into a dipsomaniac on the whim of Gail Wynand\n* Charlotte Merriam (actress who plays Mrs. Ritchey in the 1931 movie Night Nurse) who exclaims that she is a dipsomaniac several times when confronted by Barbara Stanwyck's character (Lora Hart) with the fact that Ritchey's daughter is dying from malnutrition\n* Peter Morgan Sr., (played by actor Charles Coburn) in the 1938 movie Vivacious Lady, talks about his nephew Keith Morgan's (played by James Ellison) dipsomania ways.\n* Geoffrey Firmin, protagonist of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano and one of the more recognized dipsomaniacs in fiction\n* Richard Gilmore, a character in the TV series Gilmore Girls, refers to a fundraiser speaker as a dipsomaniac in the season one episode \"P.S. I Lo...\"\n\nExamples in science\n\n* William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin writing to George FitzGerald on April 9, 1896:  I have not had a moment's peace or happiness in respect to electromagnetic theory since Nov. 28, 1846 (see vol i. p. 80 M.P.P). All this time I have been liable to fits of ether dipsomania, kept away at intervals only by rigorous abstention from thought on the subject.\nQuestion:\nIf you suffer from dipsomania what are you obsessed by\nAnswer:\nOctyldodecanol\nPassage:\nThree Times a Lady\n\"Three Times a Lady\" is a song by American soul group the Commodores, from their 1978 album Natural High. It was produced by James Anthony Carmichael and the Commodores. It was also the only Motown song to reach the Top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 that year and the Commodores's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, topping the chart for two weeks on August 12, 1978 and also went to number one the soul chart for two weeks.   The song spent three weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart. \n\nThe song also reached #1 on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart for four weeks, and was one of only a few Motown singles to reach the top spot in the UK Singles Chart, staying there for five weeks.  The song was also successful in Ireland, staying at #1 in the charts for three consecutive weeks. It was #1 in Australia for five weeks, and reached #2 in New Zealand.\n\nThe original Commodores' version of the song was included as the final track on Lionel Richie's greatest hits compilation album Back To Front, released in 1992.\n\nIn an appearance on The Early Show on June 12, 2009, Lionel Richie said he was inspired to write the song because of a comment his father made about his mother. His father said to his mother \"I love you. I want you. I need you. Forever\" hence the three times a lady. \n\nCovers\n\n* Nate Harvell recorded one of the first country versions in 1978, reaching #23 on the Billboard country chart.\n* The song was also covered in the country genre by country singer Billy \"Crash\" Craddock on his 1986 album Crash Craddock and in 2007 by Cobra Starship as an iTunes bonus track for their album ¡Viva La Cobra!. In 2001 it was covered by Anglo-Norwegian boy band a1 and featured on Motown Mania and as a bonus track on their hit single \"No More\".\n* The Shadows did an instrumental of the song on Moonlight Shadows (1986).\n* Kenny Rogers covered the song on After Dark.  It was also featured on his hits compilation All The Hits And All New Love Songs.  Rogers performed the song on the Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters television show on November 29, 1980.\n* The most successful cover version was performed by Conway Twitty, whose version appears on his 1983 album Lost in the Feeling. Twitty's version reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in the late winter of 1984.  Allmusic reviewer Tom Jurek wrote that \"Three Times a Lady\" and the previous single, \"Heartache Tonight\" \"offer(ed) a solid view of Twitty's amazing crossover potential, and his ability to take well-known pop tracks and turn them into solid country smashes long after the countrypolitan days of Chet Atkins and RCA.\"  (In addition to \"Heartache Tonight\" (a cover of a song by The Eagles), Twitty had successfully covered \"Slow Hand\" and \"The Rose,\" previously pop hits for the Pointer Sisters and Bette Midler, respectively.)\nQuestion:\n\"Which group had a 1978 UK No. 1 hit with \"\"Three Times a Lady\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nWalter Orange\nPassage:\nThe Biggest Eyes in the Animal Kingdom - Mission Blue\nThe Biggest Eyes in the Animal Kingdom – Mission Blue\nThe Biggest Eyes in the Animal Kingdom\nAugust 20, 2012\nBy Mera McGrew\nResearchers say that colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) have the largest eyes ever studied in the animal kingdom. Measuring 27cm (11in) in diameter, each eye is roughly the size of a soccer ball. “They are probably the largest eyes that have ever existed,” says Eric Warrant, a professor at the University of Lund in Sweden and an expert on animal vision.\nResearchers say these huge eyes help the colossal squid survive and thrive in the depths of the Southern Ocean. Their eyes face forward, allowing them to properly judge distances. At great depths, where there is very little light, their large eyes also help them spot large animals, including predators like sperm whales.\nRecently, Mission Blue caught up with Warrant to ask him more about his research and the massive eyes of the colossal squid.\nAt Lund University’s Department of Biology, Warrant pursues world-leading research that focuses on vision in dim light, primarily concentrating on deep-sea and nocturnal animals. In 2008, Warrant traveled to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa in Wellington to take part in the dissection of a colossal squid and investigate the morphology of their eyes along with his friend and colleague Dan-Eric Nilsson.\nBelow is a cut version of a Q&A with Eric Warrant.\nWhy do colossal squid have such large eyes?\nIn order to spot sperm whales (their major enemy) at great depths in the sea where there is almost no daylight. Sperm whales trigger bioluminescence from the great density of tiny planktonic animals that they collide with while swimming. This light creates a bright aura around and behind the whale that can be seen at a great distance in the sea (about 120 m away), but only by an animal with an eye as large as that of the colossal squid.\nIn your opinion what is the most fascinating thing about the colossal squid’s eyes and why?\nTheir sheer size. They are probably the largest eyes that have ever existed, and the next largest eyes are only 9 cm in diameter (the eyes of a large swordfish). For most visual tasks – such as detecting objects illuminated in the faint downwelling daylight – an eye of greater than 9 cm isn’t justified on the basis of visual gains per unit energy cost. The only visual task that is an exception to this is the detection of large luminous objects – the major reason for the evolution of the giant eyes of squids. This evolution was necessary in order to give them an early warning visual alarm system for detecting sperm whales.\nIn 2008, you traveled to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa in Willington to take part in the dissection of a colossal squid. Can you briefly describe what your role was within that dissection?\nMy role – together with my friend and colleague Dan-Eric Nilsson – was to investigate the morphology of the eyes of the squid to that level it was possible in an animal that had been frozen for over a year and then thawed-out.\nWhy was dissecting the colossal squid so important from a scientific standpoint?\nColossal squid are not uncommon in the deep ocean but our investigations of them are very few because they are so hard to see and to find. Most specimens that exist in museums are in very poor condition, having been found washed up on beaches in a half-rotten state. The eyes are usually in a particularly bad state. The New Zealand specimen had been caught alive on a long-line fishing vessel, dragged up onto the ship’s deck and then frozen immediately (I suspect that the ship’s crew recognized the scientific value in the specimen directly). Never before in the history of colossal squid research had so fine a specimen been obtained. Hence its enormous scientific value.\nWhat did you and other researchers discover through the dissection?\nI think this can be best answered by consulting  Te Papa’s web site .\n \nTop photo: Christine Dell’Amore. The eye pictured is not a colossal squid eye, it is a preserved giant squid eye.\nOne Comment\n“The New Zealand specimen had been caught alive on a long-line fishing vessel, dragged up onto the ship’s deck and then frozen immediately.”\nHow very cruel.\nQuestion:\nWhich creature has the largest eye?\nAnswer:\nMouchezis\nPassage:\nMotorsport\nMotorsport or motorsports is a global term used to encompass the group of competitive events which primarily involve the use of motorised vehicles, whether for racing or non-racing competition.  The terminology can also be used to describe forms of competition of two-wheeled motorised vehicles under the banner of motorcycle racing, and includes off-road racing such as motocross.\n\nFour- (or more) wheeled motorsport competition is globally governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA); and the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) governs two-wheeled competition.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1894, a French newspaper organised a race from Paris to Rouen and back, starting city to city racing.  In 1900, the Gordon Bennett Cup was established.  Closed circuit racing arose as open road racing, on public roads, was banned.  Brooklands was the first dedicated motor racing track in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing World War I, European countries organised Grand Prix races over closed courses.  In the United States, dirt track racing became popular.\n\nAfter World War II, the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised.  In the United States, stock car racing and drag racing became firmly established.\n\nMotorsports ultimately became divided by types of motor vehicles into racing events, and their appropriate organisations.\n\nOpen-wheel racing\n\nOpen-wheel racing is a set of classes of motor vehicles, with their wheels outside of, and not contained by any bodywork of their vehicle.  These have been globally classified as specific 'Formula' series - the most common being Formula One, and many others include the likes of Formula 3, Formula Ford, Formula Renault and Formula Palmer Audi.  However, in North America, the IndyCar series is their pinnacle open-wheeled racing series.  More recently, new open-wheeled series have been created, originating in Europe, which omit the 'Formula' moniker, such as GP2 and GP3.  Former 'Formula' series include Formula 5000 and Formula Two.\n\nFormula One\n\nFormula One is a class of single seat grand prix closed course racing, governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and currently organized by the privately owned company Formula One Group.  The formula is a very strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight and size. \n\nIndyCar Series\n\nIn the United States, Indy Car is a class of single seat paved track racing, organized by  INDYCAR.  Its premier race is the Indianapolis 500.\n\nEnclosed wheel racing\n\nEnclosed wheel racing is a set of classes of vehicles, where the wheels are primarily enclosed inside the bodywork of the vehicle, similar to a North American 'stock car'.\n\nSports car racing\n\nSports car racing is a set of classes of vehicles, over a closed course track, including sports cars, and specialised racing types.  The premiere race is the 24 Hours of Le Mans which takes place annually in France during the month of June.  Sports car racing rules and specifications differentiate in North America from established international sanctioning bodies. \n\nStock car racing\n\nStock car racing is a set of vehicles, that race over a speedway track, organised by NASCAR.  While once stock cars, the vehicles are now purpose built, but resemble the body design and shape of production cars.  NASCAR was organised in 1947, to combine flat track oval racing of production cars.   Daytona Beach and Road Course was founded where land speed records were set on the beach, and including part of A1A.\n\nTouring car racing\n\nTouring car racing is a set of vehicles,  modified street cars, that race over closed purpose built race tracks and street courses.\n\nOther racing\n\nMotor sports which involve competitors racing against each other include:\n*Auto (car) racing\n*Motor rallying\n*Motorcycle racing\n*Air racing\n*Kart racing\n*Boat racing\n*Hovercraft racing\n*Lawn mower racing\n*Snowmobile racing\n*Truck racing\n\nNon-racing motorsport\n\nForms of motorsport which do not involve racing include drifting, regularity rally, motorcycle trials, gymkhana, Freestyle Motocross and tractor pulling.\n\nOlympics\n\nMotorsport was a demonstration event at the 1900 Summer Olympics.\nQuestion:\nWhat famous French endurance motor racing track/city is named after the early inhabiting Cenomani Celtic people?\nAnswer:\nManceaux\nPassage:\nSciatic nerve\nThe  sciatic nerve (; also called ischiadic nerve, ischiatic nerve) is a large nerve in humans and other animals. It begins in the lower back and runs through the buttock and down the lower limb. It is the longest and widest single nerve in the human body, going from the top of the leg to the foot on the posterior aspect.  The sciatic nerve provides the connection to the nervous system for nearly the whole of the skin of the leg, the muscles of the back of the thigh, and those of the leg and foot. It is derived from spinal nerves L4 to S3. It contains fibres from both the anterior and posterior divisions of the lumbosacral plexus.\n\nStructure\n\nThe sciatic nerve is formed from the L4 to S3 segments of the sacral plexus, a collection of nerve fibres that emerge from the sacral part of the spinal cord. The fibres unite to form a single nerve in front of the piriformis muscle. The nerve passes beneath piriformis and through the greater sciatic foramen, exiting the pelvis. From here, it travels down the posterior thigh to the popliteal fossa. The nerve travels in the posterior compartment of the thigh behind (superficial to) the adductor magnus muscle, and is itself in front of (deep to) one head of the biceps femoris muscle. At the popliteal fossa, the nerve divides into its two branches:\n* The tibial nerve, which travels down the posterior compartment of the leg into the foot\n* The common peroneal nerve (also called the common fibular nerve), which travels down the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg into the foot\n\nThe sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the human body. \n\nDevelopment\n\nFunction\n\nThe sciatic nerve supplies sensation to the skin of the foot, as well as the entire lower leg (except for its inner side). Sensation to skin to the sole of the foot is provided by the tibial nerve, and the lower leg and upper surface of the foot via the common fibular nerve.\n\nThe sciatic nerve also innervates muscles. In particular:  \n* Via the tibial nerve, the muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg and sole of the foot (plantar aspect).  \n* Via the common peroneal nerve (also called the common fibular nerve), the muscles in the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. \n\nClinical significance\n\nSciatica\n\nPain caused by a compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve by a problem in the lower back is called sciatica.  Common causes of sciatica include the following lower back and hip conditions:  spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and piriformis syndrome.   Other acute causes of sciatica include coughing, muscular hypertension, and sneezing. \n\nInjury\n\nSciatic nerve injury occurs between 0.5% and 2.0% of the time during total hip arthroplasty.  Sciatic nerve palsy is a complication of total hip arthroplasty with an incidence of 0.2% to 2.8% of the time, or with an incidence of 1.7% to 7.6% following revision.  Following the procedure, in rare cases, a screw, broken piece of trochanteric wire, fragment of methyl methacrylate bone cement, or Burch-Schneider metal cage can impinge on the nerve; this can cause sciatic nerve palsy which may resolve after the fragment is removed and the nerve freed.  The nerve can be surrounded in oxidized regenerated cellulose to prevent further scarring.  Sciatic nerve palsy can also result from severe spinal stenosis following the procedure, which can be addressed by spinal decompression surgery.  It is unclear if inversion therapy is able to decompress the sacral vertebrae, it may only work on the lumbar aspects of the sciatic nerves.\n\nOther disease\n\nBernese periacetabular osteotomy resulted in major nerve deficits in the sciatic or femoral nerves in 2.1% of 1760 patients, of whom approximately half experienced complete recovery within a mean of 5.5 months. \n\nSciatic nerve exploration can be done by endoscopy in a minimally invasive procedure to assess lesions of the nerve.   Endoscopic treatment for sciatic nerve entrapment has been investigated in deep gluteal syndrome; \"Patients were treated with sciatic nerve decompression by resection of fibrovascular scar bands, piriformis tendon release, obturator internus, or quadratus femoris or by hamstring tendon scarring.\" \n\nSociety and culture\n\nAccording to Jewish law, the sciatic nerve (Hebrew: Gid hanasheh) cannot be eaten, to commemorate Jacob's  hurt in his struggle with an Angel.\nQuestion:\nWhich is the longest nerve in the human body?\nAnswer:\nIschiatic nerves\nPassage:\nGreen Hedges\nGreen Hedges was Enid Blyton's home from 1938 until near her death. She wrote most of her books there and also held the famous Story Parties there. The house was situated off Penn Road in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1938, Enid Blyton and her first husband Hugh Alexander Pollock moved to the eight-bedroomed, mock-Tudor mansion where she would live for the rest of her life. There were large lawns, tennis courts, and a rose garden. There was also a large porch at the side.\n\nAfter\n\nAfter Enid Blyton's death the house was knocked down and new houses were built in its place. A road named Blyton Close stands in the approximate location of the house.\nQuestion:\nThe daughter of which famous author of many children’s books wrote “A Childhood at Green Hedges”?\nAnswer:\nThe Little lose hen\n\n\nPassage:\nSudanese teddy bear blasphemy case\nThe Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case concerns the 2007 arrest, trial, conviction, imprisonment and subsequent release of British schoolteacher Gillian Gibbons, who taught middle-class Muslim and Christian children at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan. She was convicted of insulting Islam by allowing her class of six-year-olds to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\".\n\nArrest\n\nGillian Gibbons was born in 1953 and gained a Bachelor of Education degree from the C.F. Mott College of Education in Prescot in 1975 (the college closed in 1992).  Teaching in a school in Sudan, she was arrested for allegedly insulting Islam by allowing her class of six-year-olds to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\".\n\nInitially it was thought that the complaint had originated from a parent of one of the children at the school.  However, it was later revealed that an office assistant employed at the school, Sara Khawad, had filed the complaint and was the key witness for the prosecution. Khawad was said to be angry with the school's head teacher. \"I was used by the secretary to get at the school\", Gibbons told The Guardian shortly after her release.\n\nSudan's legal system is strongly influenced by sharia, which prohibits depictions of Muhammad and other prophets. However, many Muslim organizations in other countries publicly condemned the Sudanese over their reactions,  as Gibbons did not set out to cause offence.  The chairman of the Unity School council, Ezikiel Kondo, indicated that he perceived ulterior motives in the affair, \"The thing may be very simple, but they just may make it bigger. It's a kind of blackmail.\"\n\nConviction and reaction\n\nOn 25 November 2007, Gibbons was arrested, interrogated and then put in a cell at a local police station. On 28 November, it was reported that she had been formally charged under Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Act, for \"insulting religion, inciting hatred, sexual harassment, racism, prostitution and showing contempt for religious beliefs\". This carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment, a fine, or 40 lashes. On 29 November 2007, Gibbons was found guilty of \"insulting religion;\" one of the three counts against her, and was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and deportation.  The Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella organization of British Muslim groups, including MPACUK  said the punishment was \"completely unjustified\"  and that it was \"appalled\",  and called on the Sudanese government to intervene. \n\nOn 30 November approximately 10,000 protesters took to the streets in Khartoum,  some of them waving swords and machetes, demanding Gibbons's execution after imams denounced her during Friday prayers. During the march, chants of \"Shame, shame on the UK\", \"No tolerance – execution\" and \"Kill her, kill her by firing squad\" were heard.  Witnesses reported that government employees were involved in inciting the protests.  Gibbons was then moved to a secret location because of fears for her safety.\n\nRelease\n\nIn an attempt to push for the release of Gibbons, two British Muslim peers (members of the House of Lords), Lord Ahmed (Labour) and Baroness Warsi (Conservative), visited Sudan with hopes of talking to the country's President Omar al-Bashir. \n\nWhile the two British politicians were meeting the President on 3 December it was announced that Gibbons was to be released from prison having been granted a Presidential pardon. After eight days in jail, she was released into the care of the British embassy in Khartoum and then returned to Liverpool, after issuing a written statement saying: \"I have a great respect for the Islamic religion and would not knowingly offend anyone.\"  \n\nAfterwards\n\nThe school was closed until January 2008 for the safety of pupils and staff as reprisals were feared.\nQuestion:\nIn what Sudan city was Gillian Gibbons imprisoned for the blasphemous naming of a teddy bear incident?\nAnswer:\n",

        "origin_prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nStyx\nIn Greek mythology, Styx (; ) is a deity and a river that forms the boundary between Earth and the Underworld (the domain often called Hades, which also is the name of its ruler). The rivers Styx, Phlegethon, Acheron, Lethe, and Cocytus all converge at the center of the underworld on a great marsh, which sometimes is also called the Styx. According to Herodotus, the river Styx originates near Feneos.  Styx is also a goddess with prehistoric roots in Greek mythology as a daughter of Tethys, after whom the river is named and because of whom it had miraculous powers.\n\nSignificance of the River Styx\n\nThe deities were bound by the Styx and swore oaths upon Styx. According to classical myths, the reason related for this is that during the Titan war, Styx, the goddess of the river Styx, sided with Zeus. After the war, Zeus promised every oath be sworn upon her.  Zeus swore to give Semele whatever she wanted and was then obliged to follow through when he realized to his horror that her request would lead to her death. Helios similarly promised his son Phaëton whatever he desired, also resulting in the boy's death. Myths related to such early deities did not survive long enough to be included in historic records, but tantalizing references exist among those that have been discovered.\n\nAccording to some versions, Styx had miraculous powers and could make someone invulnerable. According to one tradition, Achilles was dipped in the waters of the river by his mother during his childhood, acquiring invulnerability, with exception of his heel, by which his mother held him. The only spot where Achilles was vulnerable was his heel, where he was struck and killed by Paris' arrow in the Trojan War. This is the source of the expression Achilles' heel, a metaphor for a vulnerable spot.\n\nStyx was primarily a feature in the afterworld of classical Greek mythology, similar to the Christian area of Hell in texts such as The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost. The ferryman Charon often is described in contemporary literature as having transported the souls of the newly dead across this river into the underworld, although in the original Greek and Roman sources, as well as in Dante, it was the river Acheron that Charon plied. Dante put Phlegyas as ferryman over the Styx and made it the fifth circle of Hell, where the wrathful and sullen are punished by being drowned in the muddy waters for eternity, with the wrathful fighting each other. In ancient times some believed that placing a coin (Charon's obol) in the mouth  of the deceased would pay the toll for the ferry to cross the Acheron River, which would lead one to the entrance of the underworld. If someone could not pay the fee it was said that they would never be able to cross the river. This ritual was performed by the relatives.\n\nThe variant spelling Stix was sometimes used in translations of Classical Greek before the twentieth century.  By metonymy, the adjective stygian came to refer to anything dark, dismal, and murky.\n\nGoddess\n\nStyx was the name of the daughter of Tethys and Oceanus, the goddess of the River Styx. In classical myths, her husband was Pallas and she gave birth to Zelus, Nike, Kratos, and Bia (and sometimes Eos). In those myths, Styx supported Zeus in the Titanomachy, where she was said to be the first to rush to his aid and for this reason her name was given the honor of being a binding oath for the deities. Knowledge of whether this was the original reason for the tradition did not survive into historical records following the religious transition that led to the pantheon of the classical era.\n\nScience\n\nAs of 2 July 2013, Styx officially became the name of one of Pluto's moons.  The other moons (Charon, Nix, Hydra, and Kerberos) also have names from Greco-Roman mythology related to the underworld.\nQuestion:\nIn Greek Mythology who was the ferryman who carried the dead to the underworld across the River Styx?\nAnswer:\nCharon (comics)\nPassage:\nInterstitial nephritis\nInterstitial nephritis  (or tubulo-interstitial nephritis) is a form of nephritis affecting the interstitium of the kidneys surrounding the tubules. This disease can be either acute, meaning it occurs suddenly, or chronic, meaning it is ongoing and eventually ends in kidney failure.\n\nCauses\n\nCommonly causes include infection, or reaction to medication such as an analgesic or antibiotics such as methicillin (meticillin). Reaction to medications causes 71%  to 92%  of cases.\n\nThis disease is also caused by other diseases and toxins that damage the kidney.  Both acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis can be caused by a bacterial infection in the kidneys known as pyelonephritis, but the most common cause is by an adverse reaction to a drug.  The drugs that are known to cause this sort of reaction are antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalexin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin less frequently than others), as well as proton-pump inhibitors, rifampicin, sulfa drugs, fluoroquinolones, diuretics, allopurinol, and phenytoin.  The time between exposure to the drug and the development of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis can be anywhere from 5 days to 5 months (fenoprofen induced).\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAt times, there are no symptoms of this disease, but when they do occur they are widely varied and can occur rapidly or gradually.      When caused by an allergic reaction, the symptoms of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis are fever (27% of patients), rash (15% of patients), and enlarged kidneys.  Some people experience dysuria, and lower back pain.  In chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis the patient can experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss.  Other conditions that may develop include hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and kidney failure.\n\nBlood tests\n\nAbout 23% of patients have eosinophilia.\n\nUrinary findings\n\nUrinary findings include:\n* Eosinophiluria: Original studies with Methicillin-induced AIN showed sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 83%.  The sensitivity is higher in patients with interstitial nephritis induced by methicillin or when the Hansel's stain is used. However, recent studies have called into question the accuracy of this test. A recent study showed that the sensitivity and specificity of urine eosinophil testing are 35.6% and 68% respectively.  \n* Isosthenuria \n* Blood in the urine and occasional RBC casts \n* Sterile pyuria: white blood cells and no bacteria\n* Nephrotic-range amount of protein in the urine may be seen with NSAID-associated AIN\n\nGallium scan\n\nThe sensitivity of an abnormal gallium scan has been reported to range from 60%  to 100%. \n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment consists of addressing the cause,  such as by removing an offending drug. There is no clear evidence that corticosteroids help.\nNutrition therapy consists of adequate fluid intake, which can require several liters of extra fluid. \n\nPrognosis\n\nThe kidneys are the only body system that are directly affected by tubulointerstitial nephritis.  Kidney function is usually reduced; the kidneys can be just slightly dysfunctional, or fail completely.\n\nIn chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, the most serious long-term effect is kidney failure.  When the proximal tubule is injured, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, uric acid, and phosphate reabsorption may be reduced or changed, resulting in low bicarbonate, known as metabolic acidosis, low potassium, low uric acid known as hypouricemia, and low phosphate known as hypophosphatemia.  Damage to the distal tubule may cause loss of urine-concentrating ability and polyuria.\n\nIn most cases of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, the function of the kidneys will return after the harmful drug is not taken anymore, or when the underlying disease is cured by treatment.  If the illness is caused by an allergic reaction, a corticosteroid may speed the recovery kidney function; however, this is often not the case.\n\nChronic tubulointerstitial nephritis has no cure.  Some patients may require dialysis.  Eventually, a kidney transplant may be needed.\nQuestion:\nWhat part of the body does interstitial nephritis affect?\nAnswer:\nHuman kidney\nPassage:\nBen Nevis, the Tallest Mountain in the U.K., Just Got a ...\nBen Nevis, the Tallest Mountain in the U.K., Just Got a Little Taller | The Weather Channel\nBen Nevis, the Tallest Mountain in the U.K., Just Got a Little Taller\nBy Andrew MacFarlane\nMar 22 2016 12:15 PM EDT\nweather.com\nDespite battling rain, sleet and snow, the Ordnance Survey, Britain’s national mapping agency, has found that the U.K.’s tallest mountain has grown a bit taller.\nBen Nevis, the country’s tallest mountain, has a new official height of 4,412 feet (1,345 meters), a full three feet taller than the previous measurement , according to a recent release by the Ordnance Survey.\nThe difference comes from the accuracy that’s achieved by using modern technologies, like GPS, rather than the surveying methods used when recording the last official measurement in 1949.\nEnlarge\nBen Nevis, Britain's tallest mountain, now stands at 4,412 feet after a recent survey. (Santiago Fajardo/Flickr)\n\"Initially, I thought, 'Well, it's just a number', but then I took a look at the map and thought, 'Oh my, I've just raised the height of the tallest mountain in Britain ',\" the Ordnance Survey’s Geodetic Consultant Mark Greaves, who was the first to view the increased height, told BBC News.\n\"And then of course your next reaction is to check and double-check. I had to make sure we'd got it absolutely right,\" he said.\nThe new height is already being published on the survey’s new Landranger paper maps and digital maps , according to a separate Ordnance Survey entry.\nConditions weren’t exactly ideal for the trip, but that carried no weight on the survey's outcome, said Angus Hemmings.\n(More:  Great Barrier Reef Coral Bleaching Reaches 'Severe' Level )\n“It was raining, sleeting and snowing at the summit, but harsh weather doesn’t affect our equipment or readings,” said Hemmings, a field surveyor. “What it did do though, was give me a greater sense of respect for the 1949 surveyors. Each day they hauled 200lbs of equipment up Ben Nevis and its surrounding mountains.”\nHemmings added that the crew had to wait until night, because strong lights had to be cast from the trig pillars onto other mountains to collect their data.\n“It took the surveyors 20 nights, because they only had three clear nights in that period to get it right,” Hemmings said. “Their effort and accuracy is remarkable.”\nMORE ON WEATHER.COM: The World's Highest Mountain—Mount Everest\n1 of 13\nQuestion:\nWhat is the highest mountain in the U.K.\nAnswer:\nBeinn Nibheis\nPassage:\nSaint Brendan Doubledside COAST GUARD Medal - Sacred Medals\nSaint Brendan Medals - Military Saint Medals - Patron Saint Medals - Medals\nMilitary Saint Medals\nSaint Brendan Doubledside COAST GUARD Medal\nAvailability: In stock\nCHAIN IS NOT INCLUDED\nAvailable in Solid 14K Yellow or White Gold, or in Sterling Silver\nSt. Brendan, called \"the Navigator\", \"the Voyager\", or \"the Bold\" is one of the early Irish monastic saints whose legends reflect their history.

From 2000 to 2012, he was the Governor of Moscow Oblast.\n\nBiography\n\nHe graduated from a Suvorov military cadet school, the Leningrad Military Commanders School and later from the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow, as well as the General Staff Academy.\n\nDuring the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Gromov did three tours of duty (1980–1982, 1985–1986, 1987–1989), and was best known for the two years as the last Commander of the 40th Army in Afghanistan. Gromov was the last Soviet soldier to leave Afghanistan, crossing on foot the Friendship Bridge spanning the Amu-Daria river on 15 February 1989, the day the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan was completed. He received the highest military award – the golden star of the Hero of the Soviet Union after Operation Magistral had lifted the siege of the city of Khost in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nAfter the Afghan war, he was chosen as a candidate for Vice President by the Communist Party in the Russian presidential election of 1991 (the candidate for President was former Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov).

The award citation indicated the organization was awarded the prize, because they “have defined the use of chemical weapons as taboo under international law. Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.”   The committee criticized Russia and the United States for not meeting the extended deadline for destruction of its chemical weapons, and noted that certain countries \"are still not members\". The OPCW was the 22nd organization to be awarded the prize. \n\nNomination\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee announced on 4 March 2013, it had received 259 nominations for the prize. This was the highest number of nominations ever: 18 more than the previous record year 2011. Of those 259 nominations, 50 were for organizations. \n\nAnnouncement\n\nThe winner of the Award was announced on 11 October 2013. The press release indicated that the OPCW was awarded the prize for \"its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons\". The announcement further reiterated the development of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which establishes the OPCW, as well as earlier instruments such as the Geneva Convention of 1925, but also indicated the use of chemical weapons during World War II and afterwards \"by both states and terrorists\".\n\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria was also mentioned as a recent event underscoring the importance of elimination of chemical weapons. The OPCW contributed to the UN mission investigating the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta   and its activities since 1 October entailed supervision of destruction activities, which followed the accession of Syria to the Chemical Weapons Convention (and its provisional application), OPCW Executive Council Decision EC-M-33/DEC.1.  and was mandated via the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118.\n\nThe Nobel Committee was critical towards Russia and the United States for not meeting their extended deadlines for the full destruction of its chemical weapons in 2012,  and mentioned that some states \"are still not members\". Non-member states of the OPCW are the states which are not party to the Chemical Weapons Convention: Angola, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, North Korea and South Sudan. \n\nCommittee\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. For the 2013 award, the members were: \n\n*Thorbjørn Jagland (chair, born 1950), former President of the Storting and former Prime Minister\n*Kaci Kullmann Five (deputy chair, born 1951), former member of Parliament and cabinet minister.\n*Inger-Marie Ytterhorn (born 1941), former member of Parliament.\n*Berit Reiss-Andersen (born 1954), former state secretary for the Minister of Justice and the Police.\n*Gunnar Stålsett (born 1935), former bishop of Oslo.\n\nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an intergovernmental organisation, located in The Hague, Netherlands. The organisation promotes and verifies the adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits the use of chemical weapons and requires their destruction. The organization was established on 29 April 1997, upon the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The verification consists both of evaluation of declarations by member states and on-site inspections. The principal body of the organization is the \"conference of states parties\", which normally is convened yearly. The Executive Council is the executive organ of the organisation and consists of 41 States Parties. The \"Technical Secretariat\" applies most of the activities mandated by the Council and is the body where most of the employees of the organisation work. Ahmet Üzümcü is Director-General of the OPCW. \n\nAll 190 parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention are automatically members of the OPCW.  Non-members are Israel and Myanmar, which are signatory states that have not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and Angola, Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan, which have neither signed nor acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. \n\nReaction\n\nOPCW Director-General Ahmet Üzümcü told reporters that he hoped his organisation's work would help \"to achieve peace in that country [Syria] and end the suffering of its people.\" \n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the organisation's work. \n\nUSA Today quoted a London-based Syrian opposition activist who doubted Syrian people would be celebrating the award.  Similarly, a spokesperson for the Syrian National Coalition labelled the prize \"ironic\". \n\nPakistani politician Imran Khan called on the USA and Russia to destroy their own chemical weapons.\nQuestion:\nWhich organisation won the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize?\nAnswer:\nOPWC\nPassage:\nAndy Williams Interview | Archive of American Television\nAndy Williams Interview | Archive of American Television\nSubmitted by Anonymous on Mon, 2011-12-26 01:43.\nGet well Andy!

Blessings in Disguise, which was originally published in 1986, is Sir Alec�s autobiography. It is a profoundly rich, subtly delineated series of sketches of self and others (among the latter, internationally famous British actors such as Gielgud and Richardson).  With an Introduction by Piers Paul Read.\nAdvertising\nEditorial Reviews\nLibrary Journal\nAlready a bestseller in England, Guinness's memoir is less autobiography than fond recollections of the many friends (``blessings'') he has accumulated in his long theatrical career. In loosely organized chapters, most centered around one of the major influences in his life (e.g., Sybil Thorndike, John Gielgud), Guinness wanders back and forth through time. The threads of Guinness's own career, marriage, and religious searching wind through these chapters in an amusingly self-deprecatory way. He describes his career as a naval officer during World War II as ``the best performance I have given,'' in a chapter full of hilarious and hair-raising episodes. Sharp imagery and marvelous word portraits make this a charming book of English theatrical lore. Marcia L. Perry, Berkshire Athenaeum, Pittsfield, Mass.\nProduct Details\nQuestion:\n\"Which actor's autobiography is entitled \"\"Blessings in Disguise\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nMerula Salaman\n\n\nPassage:\nKina-paper monetary unit, the note, a denomination, modern ...\nKina-paper monetary unit, the note, a denomination, modern money Papua New Guinea\nof 452 860 sq. km\nEnglish, to the squanderer (state) and dialects\nPG (PNG) 598\nMonetary unit - a kina ( K )=100 toea.\nIn XIX century in territory of Papua token moneys in pounds sterling, and New Guinea - in the German marks addressed.

        "origin_prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nGo ahead, make my day\n\"Go ahead, make my day\" is a catchphrase written by Charles B. Pierce and spoken by the character Harry Callahan from the 1983 film Sudden Impact. In 2005, it was chosen as No. 6 on the American Film Institute list, AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes. \n\nOrigins\n\nThe phrase \"go ahead, make my day\" was written by Charles B. Pierce, an independent filmmaker who is credited with \"story by\" in the film Sudden Impact. The actual origins of the phrase came from Pierce's father Mack, who used to tell him as a child, \"Just let me come home one more day, without you mowing that lawn, son just go ahead.....make my day\".\n\nIn the beginning of the movie, Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) goes into a diner for a morning cup of coffee where he discovers a robbery in progress. He kills all but one of the robbers in a shootout. However, the surviving robber grabs the fleeing waitress Loretta (Mara Corday), holds his gun to her head, and threatens to shoot. Instead of backing off, Harry points his .44 Magnum revolver into the man's face and dares him to shoot, saying with clenched teeth and in his characteristic rough grumble, \"Go ahead, make my day,\" meaning that if the robber attempts to harm Loretta in any way, Harry would be happy to dispatch the robber. At the end of the film, Harry, again, says \"Come on, make my day\" just before shooting Mick the rapist, who aims his stolen shotgun at Harry's lover, Jennifer Spencer.\n\nInfluence\n\nWhen speaking out against taxes at the 1985 American Business Conference, President Ronald Reagan, himself a former actor, stated \"I have my veto pen drawn and ready for any tax increase that Congress might even think of sending up. And I have only one thing to say to the tax increasers. Go ahead—make my day.\"  Pierce reacted to this saying that his proudest moment was telling his father, \"Tonight the President Ronald Reagan of the United States just quoted you.\"\n\nThe movie Sudden Impact became popular in Kenya in the early 1990s. Kenyan kids pronounced 'make my day' as \"Makmende\" probably due to influence of the local dialects. Over time, Makmende came to be used by children to refer to those who behaved in a conceited manner. In 2010, Makmende was turned into an Internet sensation all over Kenya's Internet community when Just a Band created a superhero character in the music video of their song \"Ha He.\"   The song [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLQrQ8Qvn9s Action] by Finnish band LOVEX features the line in their song lyrics.\n\nDuring his speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood ended by referencing the line.  In February 2015, The Economist featured the headline \"Go ahead, Angela, make my day\" in reference to the European debt crisis.\n\nItaly\n\nThat phrase, although in its Italian localization \"Coraggio... fatti ammazzare\", was also chosen as the title for the Italian version of the film, and it has become a catchphrase in Italy as well.\nQuestion:\n'Go ahead, make my day' is a catchphrase from which 1983 film?\nAnswer:\nJennifer Spencer\nPassage:\nThe Cars Of Only Fools And Horses | ShortList Magazine\nThe Cars Of Only Fools And Horses | ShortList Magazine\nTV\nThe cars of Only Fools and Horses\nAt a terrible pub quiz in a town called Uxbridge we once witnessed a grown man lose his tiny mind over the question, \"What is the slogan written on the side of Del Boy's famous Reliant Robin?\" THERE IS NO RELIANT ROBIN IN ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES! he scrawled on our answer sheet in angry ink. IT IS A RELIANT REGAL.\nAnd although Steve may not have got any actual points that ill fated evening, he did in a some other way have one very good point. That point being that people should pay more attention to the motors of OFAH. There may not be any Reliant Robins in Fools, but bonjour, there are some cosmic motors...\nReliant Regal 700cc Supervan\nTop speed: 55mph\nThe eagle eyed amongst you will have noticed the differing number plates seen on the van over the years in Fools. The varying plates give the game away - there were in fact multiple Reliants used on the show. Claims on how many vans were used range from six to eighteen, though lets face it anyone who owns a Regal would be mad not to paint it yellow and claim it to be a Trotter original. Ricky Hatton owns one of these \"official\" Regals, another one has been converted into a hearse and can be used to transport your dead for as little as £600 a pop. Cushty.\nBoycie's Jag\nJaguar E Type\nTop speed: 145mph\nIn the classic episode where Del and Rodders chat up a pair of transvestites, and pretend Rodney is a world renowned tennis champ called Hot Rod, they also crash this incredible machine. The car they hit? Another motor that just misses out on this list - Del's former Vauxhall Velox. The dodgy Velox is driven by the bloke who went on to play Mr Sullivan in cult show Press Gang, and his terrible Aussie accent somehow fails to kill this brilliant scene.\nDenzil's Lorry\nDAF 2800\nTop speed: 70mph\nPoor old Denzil, founder and owner of Transit Transworld Express \"Any time, any load, anywhere.\" The bearded scouser's easy access to vans and trucks always made him a prime target for Del when he needed something dodgy picking up or dropping off. The combination of the DAF and Del not only lead to the end of Denzil's marriage, but also to him being placed in a mental hospital.\nThe Pratmobile\nFord Capri Ghia\nTop speed: 122mph\nBack in Series Seven, the heavily preggers Raquel was understandably not that keen for her baby to travel around dans le van. Hence Boycey flogged the Trotters this wonderful lime beast for a very reasonable £400 (that's sixteen ponies, right?). Controversially, to our cynical old eyes, the Pratmobile seems to miraculously change from a MKII Capri to a MKIII Capri after it’s been spruced up by Del. Quite the mechanic.\nThe Jolly Boys Bus\nFord R-1114\nTop Speed: unknown\nMany cars, buses, bikes and vans have played important if slightly minor roles in the series, the Austin Alegro and Ford Cortina MKI of the title music included. One of our favourite bit part vehicles was the bus which provided the catalyst to the script when the Nags Head locals had their day out to Margate. A drunk driver, a dodgy radio, and the good decency to explode into a fireball with perfect comedy timing. What a bus. Shame it went bang really.\nRodney's Roller\nRolls Royce Silver Spirit\nTop speed: 120mph\nWhen the Trotters became millionaires Rodney bought at least two cars that we know of. A Jaguar XK8, and more famously a Roller for his brother, complete with the number plate DEL 1. The purchase of the latter nicely cues up Del's Nags Head punch line, \"I'll buy the sandwiches, cos you bought the Rolls.\" However, in hindsight it was actually a bit tight of Rodney to buy a second hand car.\nImage: YouTube\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the pub used by the Trotters in Only Fools and Horses\nAnswer:\nNag's Head, North Carolina\nPassage:\nBob Holness\nRobert Wentworth John \"Bob\" Holness (12 November 1928 – 6 January 2012) was an English radio and television presenter and occasional actor. He is best remembered as the presenter of the British version of Blockbusters.\n\nEarly life\n\nHolness was born in Vryheid, Natal, South Africa. When he was seven, his family moved to the UK, initially to Herne Bay, Kent where his grandfather Nathaniel was brought up, then later to Ashford, Kent. After attending Ashford Grammar School (now The Norton Knatchbull School) and briefly Eastbourne College he went on to Maidstone College of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts).  He then worked for a printing company before returning to South Africa. In 1955, he received his first job as a radio presenter. He married Mary Rose Clifford in 1955, whom he met in South Africa. \n\nIn 1956 he played James Bond in a radio production of Moonraker.  The couple returned to the UK in 1961. His daughter, Ros, was a member of the band Toto Coelo.\n\nHolness joined the BBC as a presenter on Late Night Extra, initially on the BBC Light Programme and later on Radio 1 and Radio 2, presenting alongside Terry Wogan, Michael Parkinson and Keith Fordyce. From 1971, the show was broadcast solely on Radio 2. Between 1975 and 1985, he was co-presenter with Douglas Cameron of the award-winning breakfast-time AM Programme on London's LBC radio station. He originally joined the station as an airborne traffic reporter, later progressing to reading networked news bulletins for IRN. He won the Variety Club Award for 'Joint Independent Radio Personality of the Year' in both 1979 and 1984. \n\nFrom 1985-97, he returned to Radio 2, presenting many shows including Bob Holness Requests the Pleasure and Bob Holness and Friends, as well as covering various weekday shows for holidaying presenters. From the late 1960s until 1998, he also presented the request programme Anything Goes on the BBC World Service.\n\nBaker Street\n\nHolness was the subject of an urban myth,   claimed to have been initiated in the 1980s by broadcaster Stuart Maconie who, writing for the New Musical Express in a section called 'Believe It Or Not', said that Holness had played the saxophone riff on Gerry Rafferty's 1978 song, \"Baker Street\".  (The actual performer was Raphael Ravenscroft.) Tommy Boyd, among others, has disputed Maconie's claim to authorship of the rumour. \n\nTelevision career\n\nIn 1962, Holness became the host of UK game show Take a Letter, was relief host of Thames Television's magazine programme Today in 1968, and from 1983 until 1994 presented the British version of Blockbusters, for which he is best known. In 1988 he starred in a celebrity special of Catchphrase. \n\nIn 1995, he hosted Yorkshire Television's big-budget game show flop Raise the Roof before becoming the chairman of a revived Call My Bluff for the BBC. Holness appeared on one episode of Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway in 2004, when he presented the last round of Ant and Dec's Blockbusters, with Ant as a contestant. \n\nHe also had an occasional acting career in television shows including: Thriller, Rex the Runt and The Impressionable Jon Culshaw.\n\nPersonal life, illness and death\n\nHolness gave his support to many charities, including the children's charities Teenage Cancer Trust, Young People's Trust for the Environment and National Children's Home (now Action for Children), of which he was vice-President from 1994. \n\nOn 24 November 2002, he suffered a major stroke, following which a brain scan revealed he had previously suffered a number of transient ischaemic attacks over several years. He also suffered from hearing loss, and began to use a hearing aid in 2003.  He was diagnosed with coeliac disease in 2005.  \n\nIn the last few years of his life he suffered from vascular dementia. He was cared for by his family at home until the last two weeks of his life when he entered Denville House nursing home. \n\nHis family announced on 6 January 2012 that he had died earlier that day, in his sleep, aged 83. He is survived by his wife, former actress Mary Rose (née Clifford), as well as their three children, Carol (known as Nancy Nova), Ros and Jon, and seven grandchildren.\nQuestion:\nOn which pop hit classic did Bob Holness famously not play the sax solo?\nAnswer:\nBAKER STREET\nPassage:\nPapists Act 1778\nThe Papists Act of 1778 is an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain (18 George III c. 60) and was the first Act for Roman Catholic relief. Later in 1778 It was also enacted by the Parliament of Ireland.\n\nBefore the Act, a number of \"Penal laws\" had been enacted in Britain and Ireland, which varied between the jurisdictions from time to time but effectively excluded those known to be Roman Catholics from public life. \n\nEffect of the Act\n\nBy this Act, an oath was imposed, which besides a declaration of loyalty to the reigning sovereign, contained an abjuration of the Pretender, and of certain doctrines attributed to Roman Catholics, such as that excommunicated princes may lawfully be murdered, that no faith should be kept with heretics, and that the Pope had temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction in Great Britain.  \n\nThose taking this oath were exempted from some of the provisions of the Popery Act 1698. The section as to taking and prosecuting priests was repealed, as well as the penalty of perpetual imprisonment for keeping a school. Roman Catholics were also enabled to inherit and purchase land, nor was an heir who conformed to the Established church any longer empowered to enter and enjoy the estate of his \"papist\" kinsman. \n\nThe passing of this act was the occasion of the Gordon Riots (1780) in which the violence of the mob was especially directed against Lord Mansfield, who had objected to various prosecutions under the statutes now repealed.\n\nThis Act remained on the statute book until it was repealed by the Promissory Oaths Act 1871 (c.48).\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the 1780 London riots which were an anti-Catholic protest against the 1778 Papists Act?\nAnswer:\nNo-Popery Riots\nPassage:\nThyme\nThyme is an evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses. \nThe most common variety is Thymus vulgaris. Thyme is of the genus Thymus of the mint family (Lamiaceae), and a relative of the oregano genus Origanum.\n\nHistory \n\nAncient Egyptians used thyme for embalming.   The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples, believing it was a source of courage.  The spread of thyme throughout Europe was thought to be due to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms and to \"give an aromatic flavour to cheese and liqueurs\". In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed beneath pillows to aid sleep and ward off nightmares.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan.  In this period, women also often gave knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves, as it was believed to bring courage to the bearer. Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals, as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life. \n\nThe name of the genus of fish Thymallus, first given to the grayling (T. thymallus described in the 1758 edition of Systema Naturae by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus) originates from the faint smell of the herb thyme, which emanates from the flesh. \n\nCultivation \n\nThyme is best cultivated in a hot, sunny location with well-drained soil.  It is generally planted in the spring, and thereafter grows as a perennial.  It can be propagated by seed, cuttings, or dividing rooted sections of the plant.  It tolerates drought well.   The plants can take deep freezes and are found growing wild on mountain highlands. Along the Italian Riviera, it is found from sea level up to 800 m.\n\nCulinary use \n\nIn some Levantine countries, and Assyria, the condiment za'atar (Arabic for thyme) contains thyme as a vital ingredient. It is a common component of the bouquet garni, and of herbes de Provence.\n\nThyme is sold both fresh and dried. While summer-seasonal, fresh greenhouse thyme is often available year round. The fresh form is more flavourful, but also less convenient; storage life is rarely more than a week. Although the fresh form only lasts a week or two under refrigeration, it can last many months if carefully frozen. \n\nFresh thyme is commonly sold in bunches of sprigs. A sprig is a single stem snipped from the plant. It is composed of a woody stem with paired leaf or flower clusters (\"leaves\") spaced  to 1\" apart. A recipe may measure thyme by the bunch (or fraction thereof), or by the sprig, or by the tablespoon or teaspoon. Dried thyme is widely used in Armenia in tisanes (called urc).\n\nDepending on how it is used in a dish, the whole sprig may be used (e.g., in a bouquet garni), or the leaves removed and the stems discarded. Usually, when a recipe specifies \"bunch\" or \"sprig\", it means the whole form; when it specifies spoons, it means the leaves. It is perfectly acceptable to substitute dried for whole thyme.\n\nLeaves may be removed from stems either by scraping with the back of a knife, or by pulling through the fingers or tines of a fork.\n\nThyme retains its flavour on drying better than many other herbs. Substitution is often more complicated than that because recipes can specify sprigs, and sprigs can vary in yield of leaves.\n\nMedicinal use \n\nOil of thyme, the essential oil of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris), contains 20–54% thymol.Thymus Vulgaris. PDR for Herbal Medicine. Montvale, NJ:  Medical Economics Company.  p. 1184.  Thyme essential oil also contains a range of additional compounds, such as p-cymene, myrcene, borneol, and linalool.   Thymol, an antiseptic, is an active ingredient in various commercially produced mouthwashes such as Listerine.   Before the advent of modern antibiotics, oil of thyme was used to medicate bandages. It has also been shown to be effective against various fungi that commonly infect toenails.  Thymol can also be found as the active ingredient in some all-natural, alcohol-free hand sanitizers.\n\nA tisane made by infusing the herb in water can be used for coughs and bronchitis.\n\nImportant species and cultivars \n\n*Thymus citriodorus – various lemon thymes, orange thymes, lime thyme\n*Thymus herba-barona (caraway thyme) is used both as a culinary herb and a ground cover, and has a very strong caraway scent due to the chemical carvone.\n*Thymus praecox  (mother of thyme, wild thyme), is cultivated as an ornamental.\n*Thymus pseudolanuginosus (woolly thyme) is not a culinary herb, but is grown as a ground cover.\n*Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme, creeping thyme) is an important nectar source plant for honeybees. All thyme species are nectar sources, but wild thyme covers large areas of droughty, rocky soils in southern Europe (both Greece and Malta are especially famous for wild thyme honey) and North Africa, as well as in similar landscapes in the Berkshire and Catskill Mountains of the northeastern US. The lowest growing of the widely used thyme is good for walkways.It is also an important caterpillar food plant for large and common blue butterflies.  \n*Thymus vulgaris (common thyme, English thyme, summer thyme, winter thyme, French thyme,  or garden thyme)  is a commonly used culinary herb. It also has medicinal uses.

The site and money for the gallery were donated to the city by Thomas Ferens, after whom it is named. The architects were S. N. Cooke and E. C. Davies. Opened in 1927, \nit was restored and extended in 1991. The gallery features an extensive array of both permanent collections and roving exhibitions. Among the exhibits is a portrait of an unknown woman by Frans Hals. The building also houses a children's gallery and a popular cafe. The building is now a Grade II listed building. \n\nIn 2009, an exhibition and live performance took place at the venue, to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of the opening of The New Adelphi Club, a live music venue less than two miles north. \n\nIn 2013, the gallery acquired a fourteenth-century painting by Pietro Lorenzetti, depicting Christ Between Saints Paul and Peter. The acquisition was jointly funded by the Ferens Endowment Fund, the Heritage Lottery Fund and Art Fund. \n\nIn May 2015, it was announced that the gallery would get a £4.5 million makeover to enable it to host the Turner Prize in 2017 as part of the UK City of Culture programme.

It is found primarily in the Caspian and Black Sea basins, and occasionally in the Adriatic Sea. Heavily fished for the female's valuable roe—known as beluga caviar— the beluga is a huge and late-maturing fish that can live for 118 years.  The species' numbers have been greatly reduced by overfishing and poaching, prompting many governments to enact restrictions on its trade. The most similar to the Huso huso beluga is the Huso dauricus kaluga, also referred to as the \"river beluga\".\n\nThe common name for the sturgeon, as for the unrelated beluga whale, is derived from the Russian word белый (belyy), meaning \"white\".\n\nBehavior\n\nThe beluga is a large predator which feeds mostly on fish, also rarely consuming waterfowl and seal pups.\n\nLike most sturgeons, the beluga is anadromous, migrating upstream in rivers to spawn.\n\nSize \n\nThe largest accepted record is of a female taken in 1827 in the Volga estuary at 1571 kg and . Several other records of aged sturgeon exceed 5 m.Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc. (1983), ISBN 978-0-85112-235-9 These great sizes mark the beluga as the largest freshwater fish in the world. A few other species of sturgeon can attain great sizes but none match the maximum sizes known for the beluga, like Chinese, Pacific White, Oceanic European, Atlantic, Baikalian, and Kaluga, the latter a close cousin which can obtained a maximum weight of 1000 kg, thus attaining the second largest sturgeon size. It may be considered as a rival in size to the ocean sunfish among all extant bony fishes although that marine, passive giant has not been nearly as heavily fished nor takes as long to attain great sizes as does the beluga so more regularly attain massive weights. The Beluga also rivals the great white shark, the Greenland shark, and the tiger shark for the title of largest actively predatory fish, only the great white easily exceeding the beluga's maximum size. The giant belugas are much larger than the Mekong giant catfish, the arapaima or other sizable rivals for the title of largest freshwater fish. Nevertheless, some scientists still consider the Mekong giant catfish to be the largest true freshwater fish, owing to sturgeons' ability to survive in seawater and that it spends much of its life in brackish environments.  \n\nBeluga of such great sizes are very old (continuing to grow throughout life) and have become increasingly rare in recent decades due to the heavy fishing of this species. Today, belugas that are caught are generally 142 - long and weigh 19 -. The female beluga is typically 20% larger than the male. \n\nUses \n\nBeluga caviar is considered a delicacy worldwide.  The flesh of the beluga, though, is not particularly renowned. Beluga caviar has long been scarce and expensive. The endangered status of the fish has made its caviar more expensive than before.\n\nIts air bladder is said to make the best isinglass. \n\nStatus \n\nIUCN classifies the beluga as critically endangered. It is a protected species listed in appendix III of the Bern Convention, and its trade is restricted under CITES appendix II. The Mediterranean population is strongly protected under appendix II of the Bern Convention, prohibiting any intentional killing of these fish.\n\nThe United States Fish and Wildlife Service has banned imports of beluga caviar and other beluga products from the Caspian Sea since October 6, 2005, after listing beluga sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\nQuestion:\nBeluga, Ossetra, Sterlet, and Sevruga are all types of what?\nAnswer:\nIkra\nPassage:\nCrucible Theatre\nThe Crucible Theatre is a theatre built in 1971 in the city centre of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. As well as theatrical performances, it hosts the most prestigious event in professional snooker, the World Championship.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Crucible Theatre was built by M J Gleeson and opened in 1971,  replacing the Playhouse Repertory theatre in Townhead Street. In 1967 Colin George, the founding Artistic Director of the Crucible, recommended a thrust stage for Sheffield, inspired by theatres created by Sir Tyrone Guthrie. Tanya Moiseiwitsch, who had been involved in designing Guthrie’s theatres, was the designer.  The architects Renton Howard Wood Levin Architects were engaged and the building itself began to take shape in 1969. It was completed in two years, on time for the opening performance in November 1971 of Fanfare, an evening's entertainment comprising children participating in an improvised scene, Chekhov’s Swan Song with Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge and a music hall finale with a Sheffield brass band.\n\nThis demonstrated the versatility of the stage, which has since been adapted to dance and musical performance, as well as classical and modern theatre, and receives touring productions, as well as hosting squash and the World Snooker Championship.\n\nThe audience sits on three sides but no member is more than the length of a cricket wicket – 22 yards (20 metres) – from the performer, or indeed a snooker ball. Consequently, although it seats 980 people the spectator has an intimate relationship with the activity on stage. Colin George and the Administrator David Brayshaw persuaded the Gulbenkian Foundation to finance for the first time the building of a professional theatre – the 400 seat Studio, which opened with the main house.\n\nIn 2001, the Crucible was awarded the Barclays ‘Theatre of the Year Award’.  It is a Grade II listed building. \n\nThe building went through a £15 million refurbishment between 2007 and late 2009 – opening during that period only for the 2008 and 2009 World Snooker Championships. \n\nThe Crucible reopened as a theatre on 11 February 2010 with a production of Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, with the official reopening by the Earl of Wessex on 18 February 2010. \n\nTheatre\n\nThe Crucible is a producing theatre, meaning shows are designed and rehearsed in-house. These productions are normally overseen by the Sheffield Theatres Group.\n\nSports venue\n\nThe World Snooker Championship tournament has been played annually in the Crucible since 1977. The Ladies World Snooker Championship was also held at the Crucible between 1998 and 2003 but was eventually withdrawn due to financial difficulties. The venue has also hosted championships of other indoor sports, such as table tennis and squash.\nQuestion:\nIn which Sheffield Theatre is the World Snooker Championship held each year?\nAnswer:\nSheffield Crucible Theatre\nPassage:\nAlvin Stardust: Obituary - BBC News\nAlvin Stardust: Obituary - BBC News\nBBC News\nImage copyright Getty Images\nImage caption Alvin Stardust in 1981\nWith his bouffant quiff and extravagant sideburns, Alvin Stardust became a huge star with 1970s glam rock hits such as My Coo Ca Choo, You You You and Jealous Mind.\nThe singer and actor, who has died aged 72, had a career spanning more than five decades that included stage musicals and a stint in soap opera Hollyoaks.\nBorn Bernard Jewry in London's Muswell Hill in 1942, Stardust moved to Mansfield in Nottinghamshire with his family where his father had a new job as a salesman.\nAccording to his official biography, his early musical influences came from the children's Saturday matinees at his local cinema where his idols were the singing cowboys, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry.\nOn his 12th birthday, the young Jewry was given his first guitar by his mother. He took it with him on a bus to Doncaster to see Buddy Holly, where he talked his way backstage and \"jammed\" with the singer and his band the Crickets.\nHolly signed the guitar and over the years it had also been autographed by music stars such as Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, Johnny Kidd, Billy Fury, Bill Haley, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.\nImage copyright PA\nImage caption Alvin Stardust, then known as Shane Fenton, at Shirley Bassey's Record Shop on West End Lane, London, in 1962\nIn an interview with The Scotsman in 2010, Stardust said he'd considered the guitar lost until he rediscovered the instrument - which he had named Peggy Sue - at his mother's house after she died. The discovery helped him decide to return to live touring.\nHe insured Peggy Sue for £2m. \"I wouldn't sell it,\" the singer told the newspaper. \"That's my teenage years and memories of my mum when she bought it for me.\"\nStardust signed his first record deal in 1961 as the frontman of Shane Fenton and the Fentones. He had been asked to step in after the death of the group's previous singer, Johnny Theakstone. The band had a number of top 40 hits in the early 1960s and toured throughout Europe.\nBut it wasn't until 1973, when he signed up with Magnet Records, the singer took the name that would make him most famous.\nAlvin Stardust's first hit My Coo Ca Choo, written by Peter Shelley, reached number two in the UK in December 1973.  The follow-up single - Jealous Mind in 1974 - also by Shelley, was his only UK number one.\nNow a household name, Stardust appeared on TV in the mid-1970s as part of the Green Cross Code road safety campaign.\nImage copyright PA\nImage caption Alvin Stardust and Liza Goddard on their wedding day in 1981\nSuccess continued into the 1980s with top 10 hits Pretend, I Feel Like Buddy Holly (written and produced by Mike Batt) and I Won't Run Away.\nIn the 1990s, Stardust turned to acting and made stage appearances in shows such as Godspell and David Copperfield - The Musical.\nHe spent six months in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as the Child Catcher at the London Palladium in 2005.\nHe presented his own Sunday morning children's TV series, It's Stardust, on ITV in the late 1980s, while other TV appearances included Hollyoaks - where he played pub landlord Greg Andersen in 1995-96 - and Doctors. More recently he spoofed his Green Cross Code campaign on Harry Hill's TV Burp.\nReturning to touring in 2010, Stardust resurrected his leather-clad persona singing his hits and cover versions.\nImage copyright Getty Images\nImage caption Alvin Stardust, pictured here in 2010, was still touring until shortly before his death\nA Guardian review of a gig in Skegness said Stardust did \"outrageously sensual things to Duffy's Mercy and Johnny Kidd's Shakin' All Over\".\nIt concluded: \"As My Coo Ca Choo sees him spraying champagne over gyrating fans well past retirement age, Stardust's career seems as wonderfully ludicrous as ever.\"\nStardust married three times. His first wife was Iris Caldwell, with whom he had two sons, Shaun and Adam. His second wife was the actress Liza Goddard, with whom he had a daughter, Sophie.\nHis third wife was Julie Paton, an actress and choreographer, with whom he had a daughter, Millie.\nStardust re-recorded many of his hits for the I Love Rock and Roll album on Universal Records in 2010.   The singer, who lived in Billingshurst, West Sussex, had a new album - Alvin - due for release in early November 2014.\nOn his website he described it as \"a new and exciting departure for me\".\nQuestion:\nSinger Alvin Stardust played pub landlord Greg Andersen in which UK tv soap?\nAnswer:\nDanny Tennant\nPassage:\nPeristalsis\nPeristalsis is a radially symmetrical contraction and relaxation of  muscles that propagates in a wave down a tube, in an anterograde direction.\n\nIn much of a digestive tract such as the human gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscle tissue contracts in sequence to produce a peristaltic wave, which propels a ball of food (called a bolus while in the esophagus and upper gastrointestinal tract and chyme in the stomach) along the tract. Peristaltic movement comprises relaxation of circular smooth muscles, then their contraction behind the chewed material to keep it from moving backward, then longitudinal contraction to push it forward.\n\nEarthworms use a similar mechanism to drive their locomotion,  and some modern machinery imitates this design.\n\nThe word comes from New Latin and is derived from the Greek peristellein, \"to wrap around,\" from peri-, \"around\" + stellein, \"draw in, bring together; set in order\". \n\nHuman physiology\n\nEsophagus\n\nAfter food is chewed into a bolus, it is swallowed and moved through the esophagus. Smooth muscles contract behind the bolus to prevent it from being squeezed back into the mouth. Then rhythmic, unidirectional waves of contractions work to rapidly force the food into the stomach. The migrating motor complex (MMC) helps trigger peristaltic waves. This process works in one direction only and its sole esophageal function is to move food from the mouth into the stomach (the MMC also functions to clear out remaining food in the stomach to the small bowel, and remaining particles in the small bowel into the colon).\n\nIn the esophagus, two types of peristalsis occur:\n* First, there is a primary peristaltic wave, which occurs when the bolus enters the esophagus during swallowing. The primary peristaltic wave forces the bolus down the esophagus and into the stomach in a wave lasting about 8–9 seconds. The wave travels down to the stomach even if the bolus of food descends at a greater rate than the wave itself, and continues even if for some reason the bolus gets stuck further up the esophagus.\n* In the event that the bolus gets stuck or moves slower than the primary peristaltic wave (as can happen when it is poorly lubricated), stretch receptors in the esophageal lining are stimulated and a local reflex response causes a secondary peristaltic wave around the bolus, forcing it further down the esophagus, and these secondary waves continue indefinitely until the bolus enters the stomach. The process of peristalsis is controlled by medulla oblongata. Esophageal peristalsis is typically assessed by performing an esophageal motility study.\n\nDuring vomiting, the propulsion of food up the oesophagus and out the mouth comes from contraction of the abdominal muscles; peristalsis does not reverse in the esophagus.\n\nSmall intestine\n\nOnce processed and digested by the stomach, the milky chyme is squeezed through the pyloric sphincter into the small intestine. Once past the stomach, a typical peristaltic wave only lasts for a few seconds, travelling at only a few centimeters per second. Its primary purpose is to mix the chyme in the intestine rather than to move it forward in the intestine. Through this process of mixing and continued digestion and absorption of nutrients, the chyme gradually works its way through the small intestine to the large intestine.\n\nIn contrast to peristalsis, segmentation contractions result in that churning and mixing without pushing materials further down the digestive tract.\n\nLarge intestine \n\nAlthough the large intestine has peristalsis of the type that the small intestine uses, it is not the primary propulsion. Instead, general contractions called mass movements occur one to three times per day in the large intestine, propelling the chyme toward the rectum. Mass movements often tend to be triggered by meals, as the presence of chyme in the stomach and duodenum prompts them.\n\nLymph \n\nThe human lymphatic system has no central pump.  Instead, lymph circulates through peristalsis in the lymph capillaries, as well as valves in the capillaries, compression during contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle, and arterial pulsation.\n\nSperm \n\nDuring ejaculation, the smooth muscle in the walls of the vas deferens contracts reflexively in peristalsis, propelling sperm from the testicles to the urethra. \n\nEarthworms\n\n \nThe earthworm is a limbless annelid worm with a hydrostatic skeleton that moves by peristalsis. Its hydrostatic skeleton consists of a fluid-filled body cavity surrounded by an extensible body wall. The worm moves by radially constricting the anterior portion of its body, resulting in an increase in length via hydrostatic pressure. This constricted region propagates posteriorly along the worm's body. As a result, each segment is extended forward, then relaxes and re-contacts the substrate, with hair-like setae preventing backwards slipping.\n\nMachinery\n\nA peristaltic pump is a positive-displacement pump in which a motor pinches advancing portions of a flexible tube to propel a fluid within the tube. The pump isolates the fluid from the machinery, which is important if the fluid is abrasive or must remain sterile.\n\nRobots have been designed that use peristalsis to achieve locomotion, as the earthworm uses it.  \n\nRelated terms\n\n*Catastalsis is a related intestinal muscle process. \n*Aperistalsis refers to a lack of propulsion. It can result from achalasia of the smooth muscle involved.\n*Basal electrical rhythm is a slow wave of electrical activity that can initiate a contraction.\n\nNotes and references\nQuestion:\nWhat is the common name for peristalsis?\nAnswer:\nDeglutition disorders\nPassage:\nChannel 4 signs comedian Adam Hills on exclusive contract ...\nChannel 4 signs comedian Adam Hills on exclusive contract - Channel 4 - Info - Press\nChannel 4 signs comedian Adam Hills on exclusive contract\ngoogle\nC4 announced today that comedian Adam Hills has signed an exclusive one year deal with the channel.\nComing off the critically acclaimed run as the host of The Last Leg, the late night show that ran daily during C4's coverage of the Paralympics, Hills will return with A Last Leg Christmas Special and a series run in 2013.

It featured a moulded plastic hopper on a steel frame and a spherical plastic wheel, allowing increased manoeuvrability. Dyson said that the surface area of the ball, larger than that of a conventional design, made the wheelbarrow easier to use in soft soil and more laterally stable with heavy loads on uneven ground. \n\nThe original design featured a galvanised steel hopper. Later, the design was changed to a plastic hopper, with an optional clip-on height-extension piece. \n\nThe Ballbarrow won the Building Design Innovation Award in 1977.

Ad hoc tests of sobriety such as making drivers stand on one leg, or walk a straight line, were thrust aside for a more scientific measure, though the breathalyser was initially only used for indicative purposes, a subsequent blood or urine test the actual evidential proof. Three years previously tests had hit on the blood alcohol level of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml as the limit beyond which driving was unsafe. The necessary legislation received royal assent in May 1967; and police forces were issued with the breathalyser equipment in preparation. The first driver to be tested happened to be stopped in Shropshire .\nSomewhat incredibly there was major resistance to the very idea of the breathalyser test, and the 12-month driving ban for those caught over the limit. Even after the introduction Barbara Castle faced protests ï¿½ at one public event a group of publicans berated her for the damage it was doing to their business. But in the first 12 months in which the device was used, and with the additional push of an advertising campaign, road deaths reduced by more than 1100, and serious injuries sustained in car accidents by more than 11,000.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nHans-Gunnar Liljenwall\nHans-Gunnar Liljenwall (born 9 July 1941) is a Swedish modern pentathlete  who caused the disqualification of the Swedish team at the 1968 Summer Olympics for alcohol use. Liljenwall was the first athlete to be disqualified at the Olympics for drug use, following the introduction of anti-doping regulations by the International Olympic Committee in 1967.   Liljenwall reportedly had \"two beers\" to calm his nerves before the pistol shooting event.  The Swedish team eventually had to return their bronze medals. \n\nLiljenwall also participated in the 1964 and 1972 Olympics. In 1964 he finished 11th individually and fourth with the team, and in 1972 he placed 25th and fifth, respectively.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the cause of the disqualification of Swedish pentathlete Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall at Mexico City in 1968, the first as a result of failing a doping test at an Olympic Games?\nAnswer:\nBrewing industry\nPassage:\nEdge (geometry)\nFor edge in graph theory, see Edge (graph theory)\nIn geometry, an edge is a particular type of line segment joining two vertices in a polygon, polyhedron, or higher-dimensional polytope.  In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary,  and is often called a side. In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two faces meet.  A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal.\n\nRelation to edges in graphs\n\nIn graph theory, an edge is an abstract object connecting two graph vertices, unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment.\nHowever, any polyhedron can be represented by its skeleton or edge-skeleton, a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges.  Conversely, the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by Steinitz's theorem as being exactly the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs. \n\nNumber of edges in a polyhedron\n\nAny convex polyhedron's surface has Euler characteristic\n\nV - E + F = 2,\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula. Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces. For example, a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces, and hence 12 edges.\n\nIncidences with other faces\n\nIn a polygon, two edges meet at each vertex; more generally, by Balinski's theorem, at least d edges meet at every vertex of a d-dimensional convex polytope. \nSimilarly, in a polyhedron, exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge,  while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge.\n\nAlternative terminology\n\nIn the theory of high-dimensional convex polytopes, a facet or side of a d-dimensional polytope is one of its (d − 1)-dimensional features, a ridge is a (d − 2)-dimensional feature, and a peak is a (d − 3)-dimensional feature. Thus, the edges of a polygon are its facets, the edges of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron are its ridges, and the edges of a 4-dimensional polytope are its peaks..\nQuestion:\nHow many sides has a dodecagon?\nAnswer:\ntwelve\nPassage:\nKinross services\nKinross services is a motorway service station near Kinross, Scotland.

The 304 mi line provides three daily round-trips along the Pontiac–Detroit–Chicago route. It carries a heritage train name descended from the New York Central (Michigan Central).\n\nDuring fiscal year 2015, the Wolverine carried 465,627 passengers, a 0.3% decrease from FY 2014's total of 477,157 passengers.   The service had a total ticket revenue of US$18.96 million in FY 2015, an 0.3% increase from FY 2014's $18.90 million total revenue.\n\nHistory\n\nPrior to Amtrak's takeover of most private-sector passenger service in 1971 the Wolverine was one of three trains which operated over the Michigan Central route between Chicago and Detroit. Under Penn Central operation it continued through South-Western Ontario (Canada) to Buffalo, New York. Amtrak retained two trains (the other was the renamed St. Clair) and truncated the operation to Detroit but otherwise changed little. In April 1975, Amtrak introduced French-built Turboliner equipment to the Michigan route and added a third round-trip. A pool of three Turboliner trainsets served the route, and the three round-trip pairs were numbered 350—355, train numbers which are still in use today. Amtrak dropped the individual train names and rebranded all three Turboliner, in common with similar services to St. Louis, Missouri and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The new equipment led to massive gains in ridership, topping 340,000 in 1975 and 370,000 in 1976.\n\nThe Turboliners became a victim of their own success. Although fast (and flashy), they were unable to reach their design speed of 125 mph because of the poor quality of the Penn Central track in Michigan. The five-car fixed consists had a maximum capacity of 292 passengers, which was often not enough. Starting in March 1976 Amtrak began replacing some of the Turboliners with conventional equipment, including new Amfleet coaches. Individual names returned to the corridor, with the heretofore unnamed third train becoming the Twilight Limited. The last Turboliners left the corridor in 1981.\n\nAmtrak extended the Wolverine and Twilight Limited to Pontiac on May 5, 1994. With this change service began at a new station in Detroit's New Center. Although the Michigan Central Station in Corktown, Detroit had closed on January 6, 1988, trains continued to stop at a temporary platform just east of the old station. Besides Pontiac, new stations were opened at Royal Oak and Troy. The Lake Cities also began serving Pontiac after the end of Toledo service in 1995. \n\nAmtrak dropped individual names again in 2004 and named all three trains Wolverine.\n\nDue to the increased ridership on these trains, Amtrak executive Morell Savoy, the Central Division Superintendent, spearheaded a test run of Chicago-Kalamazoo Wolverines from September 2, 2010, to September 7, 2010. This was done to determine all that would be involved in operations should Amtrak decide to initiate such service in the future. \n\nHigher-speed operation \n\nThe federal government considers high-speed rail service to be rail service which at any time reaches the speed of 110 mph or higher.  In 2006 the Detroit–Chicago corridor was designated by the Federal Railroad Administration as a high-speed rail corridor  and in October 2010, the State of Michigan received US$150 million from the federal government to increase track speeds to 110 mph between Kalamazoo and Dearborn. \n\nAmtrak owns the 97 mi stretch of the Wolverine's route from Porter, Indiana to Kalamazoo, Michigan and it is the longest segment of track owned by Amtrak outside of the Northeast Corridor. Starting in January 2002 Amtrak began track improvements to increase the allowed speed along this section of track. Amtrak trains currently travel at top speeds of 110 mph along this section of track. \n\nIn December 2012, MDOT completed its purchase from Norfolk Southern of 135 mi of track between Kalamazoo and Dearborn.  This will make it easier to maintain track and eventually upgrade it to 110 mph running by late 2017. As part of the purchase agreement, MDOT also agreed to double-track the line east of Ypsilanti.[http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0%2c4616%2c7-151-9620_11057-263585--%2c00.html MDOT - MDOT seeks to improve both passenger and freight rail lines with purchase of Norfolk Southern Railway track]\n\nRoute details\n\nThe Wolverine operates over Norfolk Southern Railway, Amtrak, and Canadian National Railway trackage:\n*NS Chicago Line, Chicago to Porter\n*Amtrak Chicago–Detroit Line, Porter to Kalamazoo\n*MDOT (d/b/a Amtrak) Michigan Line, Kalamazoo to Dearborn\n*CN South Bend Sub from CP Gord to CP Baron (about .8 miles) in Battle Creek, MI\n*Amtrak Chicago–Detroit Line, Dearborn to West Detroit\n*CR North Yard Branch, West Detroit to Vinewood\n*CN Shore Line Subdivision and Holly Subdivision, Vinewood to Pontiac\n\nStation stops \n\nEquipment\n\n, each Wolverine operates with two General Electric Genesis P42DC locomotives, 3-5 Horizon coaches, and an Amfleet cafe/business class car. In the winter, Superliners are sometimes used. The equipment pool for the Wolverines comprises 14 Horizon coaches and 3.5 Amfleet cafe/business class cars (one is shared with the Blue Water), split across three consists. The locomotives usually operate in a push-pull configuration, however sometimes both will be at the head end.  Due to the FRA requirement of positive train control for operations above 79 MPH, locomotives on the Wolverine are required to have Positive Train Control, supplied by Amtrak's Incremental Train Control System. Because of this modification the units are usually captive to the Michigan services.\n\nBetween 2016-2018 Michigan expects to take delivery of new bilevel cars which will displace the Horizons and Amfleets in regular service. In addition, in early 2014 the Michigan Department of Transportation issued a request for proposal aimed at acquiring additional passenger equipment for use between 2014-2017.  \n\nIn September 2014, the state of Michigan reached an agreement with Talgo, a Spanish railcar manufacturer, to buy two trainsets for the Wolverine, at a cost of $58 million.  The trains had been previously built for the state of Wisconsin, before plans for expanded passenger rail service in that state were canceled and the trainsets placed in storage.  The new equipment will provide a substantial upgrade in passenger amenities over the Amtrak-owned railcars used on the route.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the United States is known as the Wolverine State'?\nAnswer:\nDemographics of Michigan\nPassage:\nThe History of Black Friday\nThe History of Black Friday\nGet Black Friday 2017 Deal Alerts!\nGet Deals\n×\nCheck Your Email Now.

Black Friday is the Friday after Thanksgiving, and it's one of the major shopping days of the year in the United States -falling anywhere between November 23 and 29. While it's not recognized as an official US holiday, many employees have the day off -except those working in retail.\nThe term “Black Friday” was coined in the 1960s to mark the kickoff to the Christmas shopping season. “Black” refers to stores moving from the “red” to the “black,” back when accounting records were kept by hand, and red ink indicated a loss, and black a profit. Ever since the start of the modern Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 1924, the Friday after Thanksgiving has been known as the unofficial start to a bustling holiday shopping season.\nIn the 1960's, police in Philadelphia griped about the congested streets, clogged with motorists and pedestrians, calling it “Black Friday.” In a non-retail sense, it also describes a financial crisis of 1869: a stock market catastrophe set off by gold spectators who tried and failed to corner the gold market, causing the market to collapse and stocks to plummet.\nWhy did it become so popular?\nAs retailers began to realize they could draw big crowds by discounting prices, Black Friday became the day to shop, even better than those last minute Christmas sales. Some retailers put their items up for sale on the morning of Thanksgiving, or email online specials to consumers days or weeks before the actual event. The most shopped for items are electronics and popular toys, as these may be the most drastically discounted. However, prices are slashed on everything from home furnishings to apparel.\nBlack Friday is a long day, with many retailers opening up at 5 am or even earlier to hordes of people waiting anxiously outside the windows. There are numerous doorbuster deals and loss leaders – prices so low the store may not make a profit - to entice shoppers. Most large retailers post their Black Friday ad scans, coupons and offers online beforehand to give consumers time to find out about sales and plan their purchases. Other companies take a different approach, waiting until the last possible moment to release their Black Friday ads , hoping to create a buzz and keep customers eagerly checking back for an announcement.\nMore and more, consumers are choosing to shop online, not wanting to wait outside in the early morning chill with a crush of other shoppers or battle over the last most-wanted item. Often, many people show up for a small number of limited-time \"door-buster\" deals, such as large flat-screen televisions or laptops for a few hundred dollars. Since these coveted items sell out quickly, quite a few shoppers leave the store empty handed. The benefit of online shopping is that you will know right away if the MP3 player you want is out of stock, and can easily find another one without having to travel from store to store. Also, many online retailers have pre-Black Friday or special Thanksgiving sales, so you may not even have to wait until the big day to save. So, there you have it - the Black Friday history behind the best shopping day of the year!\nQuestion:\n\"The \"\"boob tube\"\" is an item of clothing in the UK; but to what did the term refer when it was originally coined in the USA?\"\nAnswer:\nBabble box\nPassage:\nRoy Thinnes\nRoy Thinnes (born April 6, 1938) is an American television and film actor best known for his portrayal of lonely hero David Vincent in the ABC 1967-68 television series The Invaders. He also played Alfred Wentworth in the pilot episode of Law & Order. He starred in the 1969 British science fiction film, Journey to the Far Side of the Sun (also known as Doppelgänger).\n\nEarly life and career\n\nThinnes was born in Chicago and educated at Los Angeles City College. His first primetime role was as a brother to ex-cop Lee Marvin in a 1964 episode of The Untouchables, called \"A Fist of Five\". Later he appeared as Ben Quick in the short-lived 1965-66 television series The Long Hot Summer, which ran on ABC. During its run he received around 1,500 letters a week from women and appeared on the cover of TV Guide (April 9–15, 1966 issue) for his one and only time to date. The TV series The Invaders soon followed, with Thinnes playing an architect named David Vincent who accidentally witnesses the arrival of aliens from another planet and wages a seemingly hopeless one-man campaign against them. The series became a cult classic, leading to other 'aliens vs earthlings' films and TV shows. Another short-lived series in which Thinnes starred was in the lead role on The Psychiatrist as Dr. James Whitman. In 1963, Thinnes guest starred as David Dunlear in the episode \"Something Crazy's Going On in the Back Room\" of The Eleventh Hour. In 1964, he appeared twice in episodes \"Murder by Scandal\" and the \"Lost Lady Blues\" of the 13-episode CBS drama The Reporter starring Harry Guardino as journalist Danny Taylor of the fictitious New York Globe newspaper.  Thinnes also appeared as a guest star on Twelve O'Clock High, becoming a casualty of war while commanding a B-17 on a dangerous mission. He appeared as intrepid writer and investigator of the supernatural David Norliss in 1973's The Norliss Tapes, a pilot for an unproduced TV series, and played a suspicious schoolmaster in the TV movie Satan's School for Girls with Kate Jackson. He also appeared in the disaster films Airport 1975 as the co-pilot, and The Hindenburg as a sadistic SS captain. Thinnes was cast in Alfred Hitchcock's 1976 film Family Plot in the role of nefarious jeweler Arthur Adamson when Hitchcock's first choice, William Devane, was unavailable. Thinnes had already shot several scenes for the film when Devane suddenly became available. Hitchcock fired Thinnes and re-shot all of his scenes. Thinnes confronted Hitchcock in a restaurant and asked the director why he was fired. Flabbergasted, Hitchcock simply looked at Thinnes until the actor left. Some shots of Thinnes as the character (from behind) remain in the film.  \n\nDuring the 1982-1983 season, Thinnes appeared as Nick Hogan in 35 episodes of Falcon Crest starring Jane Wyman. Thinnes thereafter played Roger Collins in the 1991 revival of TV's Dark Shadows. He also appeared on General Hospital as Phil Brewer from 1963 to 1965, in the 1979 miniseries From Here to Eternity as the husband of Natalie Wood, on One Life to Live as Alex Crown from 1984 to 1985, and as Sloan Carpenter from 1992 to 1995. He also played a lead role in \"The Final Chapter,\" the first episode of the 1977 series Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected (known in the United Kingdom as Twist in the Tale), and in \"The Crystal Scarab\", a first-season episode of Poltergeist: The Legacy in 1996. Thinnes was once considered by Paramount for the part of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. He also appeared in the 1988 pilot episode of Law & Order, \"Everybody's Favorite Bagman\", as District Attorney  Alfred Wentworth. By the time the show was picked up in 1990, however, Thinnes was contractually obligated to another TV series, and so his character was replaced with D.A. Adam Schiff, played by Steven Hill. Thinnes made two appearances in The X-Files as Jeremiah Smith, an alien rebel with healing and shape-shifting abilities. \n\nThinnes also appeared in the 1995 TV mini-series The Invaders starring Scott Bakula, in which he returned as a much older David Vincent. Thinnes twice appeared on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live playing two different characters.  From 1984-1985, he played the role of \"Alex Crown\" and from 1992–1995, he played the role of \"Gen. Sloan Carpenter\". During both of his stints on the show, his characters became a father-in-law to the same character, Cassie Callison. In 2005, Thinnes co-starred as Dr. Theophile Peyron in the movie The Eyes Of Van Gogh. The film concerns Vincent van Gogh (played by Alexander Barnett, who also wrote and directed) and his voluntary stay in an insane asylum. The movie focuses on Van Gogh's relationships with Dr. Peyron, as well as fellow Expressionist Paul Gauguin, and his brother, Theo. Thinnes recently provided audio commentary for the official DVD releases of The Invaders. \n\nPersonal life\n\nThinnes was married to actress Lynn Loring from 1967 to 1984. In 1969, Loring gave birth to their son, Christopher Dylan Thinnes.,  and a daughter, Casey Thinnes, (born 1974). In 2005, Thinnes married film editor Stephanie Batailler. \n\nFilmography\n\n*The Invaders (Television) January 10, 1967 to March 26, 1968\n*Doppelgänger (1969)\n*Black Noon (1971)\n*Death Race (1973)\n*The Horror at 37,000 Feet (1973)\n*The Norliss Tapes (1973)\n*Charley One-Eye (1973)\n*Satan's School for Girls (1973)\n*Airport 1975 (1974)\n*The Hindenburg (1975)\n*Code Name: Diamond Head (1977)\n*Terminal (1996)\n*Broken English (2007)\nQuestion:\nWhat was Roy Thinnes' character name in 'The Invaders'?\nAnswer:\nEvil D\nPassage:\nCarolyn Davidson\nCarolyn Davidson is a graphic designer best known for designing the Nike \"swoosh\" logo.

She started as a journalism major, but switched to design after taking a design course to \"fill an empty elective.\"  Phil Knight, who was teaching an accounting class at the university, overheard Davidson say that she couldn't afford oil painting supplies, and asked her to do some work for what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, Inc. Knight asked Davidson to design a shoe stripe logo that \"had something to do with movement.\" She gave him five different designs, one of which was the \"swoosh.\"  Needing to choose a logo in order to meet looming production deadlines, Knight settled on the swoosh, after rejecting four other designs by Davidson. At the time, he stated of the logo, \"I don't love it, but it will grow on me.\"  For her services, the company paid her $35, which, if adjusted for inflation for 2015, would be the value equivalent of about $205.  Davidson continued working for Blue Ribbon Sports (it officially became Nike, Inc. in 1971), until the design demands of the growing company were beyond one person's capacity. In 1976, the company hired its first external advertising agency, John Brown and Partners, and Davidson went on to work on other clients' needs.\n\nIn September 1983, nearly three years after the company went public, Knight invited Davidson to a company lunch. There, he presented her with a diamond ring engraved with the Swoosh, and an envelope filled with 500 shares of Nike stock (which have since split into more shares).   Of the gift, Davidson says, \"this was something rather special for Phil to do, because I originally billed him and he paid that invoice.\" Davidson went on to be known as \"The Logo Lady.\" In 1995, Nike removed the word \"Nike\" from the logo. The \"swoosh\" stands alone as the brand's logo.\nQuestion:\nIn 1964, what did University of Oregon grad. student Carolyn Davidson design for $35?\nAnswer:\nSwoosh logo\nPassage:\nFreestyle skiing\nFreestyle skiing is a  skiing discipline created by skigod Steve Stepp comprising aerials, moguls, cross, half-pipe and slopestyle as part of the winter olympics. It can consist of a skier performing aerial flips and spins, and can include skiers sliding rails and boxes on their skis. It is also commonly referred to as freeskiing, jibbing, as well as many other names around the world.\n\nHistory \n\nAerial skiing was developed in about 1950 by Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen. The International Ski Federation (FIS) recognized freestyle as a sport in 1979 and brought in new regulations regarding certification of athletes and jump techniques in an effort to curb the dangerous elements of the competitions. The first FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup was staged in 1980 and the first FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships took place in 1986 in Tignes, France.  Freestyle skiing was a demonstration event at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Mogul skiing was added as an official medal event at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, and the aerials event was added for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. Stein Eriksen was a silver medalist in slalom.\n\nForms of freestyle skiing \n\nAerial skiing (no style) \n\nAerialists ski off 2-4 meter jumps, that propel them up to 6 meters in the air (which can be up to 20 meters above the landing height, given the landing slope).  Once in the air, aerialists perform multiple flips and twists before landing on a 34 to 39-degree inclined landing hill about 30 meters in length.  The top male aerialists can currently perform triple back flips with up to four or five twists.\n\nAerial skiing is a judged sport, and competitors receive a score based on jump takeoff (20%), jump form (50%) and landing (30%). A degree of difficulty (DD) is then factored in for a total score. Skiers are judged on a cumulative score of two jumps. These scores do not generally carry over to the next round.\n\nAerialists train for their jumping maneuvers during the summer months by skiing on specially constructed water ramps and landing in a large swimming pool. An example of this is the Utah Olympic Park training facility. A water ramp consists of a wooden ramp covered with a special plastic mat that when lubricated with sprinklers allows an athlete to ski down the ramp towards a jump.  The skier then skis off the wooden jump and lands safely in a large swimming pool.  A burst of air is sent up from the bottom of the pool just before landing to break up the surface tension of the water, thus softening the impact of the landing.  Skiers sometimes reinforce the skis that they use for water-ramping with 6mm of fiberglass or cut holes in the front and back in order to soften the impact when landing properly on their skis.\n\nSummer training also includes training on trampolines, diving boards, and other acrobatic or gymnastic training apparatus.\n\nMogul skiing \n\nMoguls are a series of bumps on a trail formed when skiers push the snow into mounds or piles as they execute short-radius turns.\n\nSki ballet \n\nSki ballet (later renamed acroski) was a competitive discipline until the International Ski Federation ceased all formal competition of this event after 2000.\n\nSki cross \n\nSki cross is based on the snowboarding boardercross. Despite it being a timed racing event, it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle.\n\nHalf-pipe skiing \n\nHalf-pipe skiing takes the well-known halfpipe to the next level. Competitors gradually ski to the end of the pipe by doing flips and tricks.\n\nSlopestyle \n\nEquipment \n\nTwin-tip skis are used in events such as slopestyle and halfpipe. Mogul skis are used in moguls and sometimes in aerials. Specially designed racing skis are used in ski cross. Ski bindings took a major design change to include plate bindings mounted to the bottom of the skiers boot to allow for multi-directional release.\nQuestion:\nWhen did freestyle skiing first became a sport contested at the World Olympics?\nAnswer:\n1992\nPassage:\nGuatemalan quetzal\nThe quetzal (; code: GTQ) is the currency of Guatemala, named after the national bird of Guatemala, the resplendent quetzal.\n\nIn ancient Mayan culture, the quetzal bird's tail feathers were used as currency. It is divided into 100 centavos or lenes in Guatemalan slang. The plural is quetzales.\n\nExchange rate \n\nHistory\n\nThe quetzal was introduced in 1925 during the term of President José María Orellana, whose image appears on the obverseof the one-quetzal bill. It replaced the peso. Until 1987, the quetzal was pegged to and domestically equal to the United States dollar and before the pegging to the US dollar, it was pegged to the French franc as well, since the quetzal utilized the gold standard.\n\nCoins\n\nIn 1925, coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10 centavos, ¼, ½ and 1 quetzal were introduced, although the majority of the 1 quetzal coins were withdrawn from circulation and melted. ½ and 2 centavos coins were added in 1932. Until 1965, coins of 5 centavos and above were minted in 72% silver. ½ and 1 quetzal coins were reintroduced in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Coins currently in circulation are:\n*1 centavo\n*5 centavos\n*10 centavos\n*25 centavos\n*50 centavos\n*1 quetzal\n\nBanknotes\n\nThe first banknotes were issued by the Central Bank of Guatemala in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 100 quetzales, with ½ quetzal notes added in 1933. In 1946, the Bank of Guatemala took over the issuance of paper money, with its first issues being overprints on notes of the Central Bank.  Except for the introduction of 50 quetzales notes in 1967, the denominations of banknotes were unchanged until ½ and 1 quetzal coins replaced notes at the end of the 1990s.\n\nIn the top-right corner of the obverse face of each banknote, the value is displayed in Mayan numerals, representing Guatemala's cultural history.\n\nThe Bank of Guatemala has introduced a polymer banknote of 1 quetzal on August 20, 2007. The Bank of Guatemala has also introduced a 5 quetzal polymer banknote on November 14, 2011.\nQuestion:\nThe quetzal is the basic monetary unit of which country?\nAnswer:\nRepública de Guatemala\nPassage:\nShakespeare becomes first commoner on GB stamps - Britain\nShakespeare becomes first commoner on GB stamps - Britain\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our use of cookies.

It argued that its special issue was to celebrate an event of international importance (the annual Shakespeare Festival at Stratford), rather than the man himself.\nNevertheless, this was a real break with previous policy, in that the four lower denominations featured the first portrait of a commoner to appear on British stamps.\nIn the original version of the Droeshout portrait the poet faced left. On the stamps it was reversed so that he faced towards the centre, balancing the familiar Dorothy Wilding portrait of the Queen.\nScene on stage\nDesigned by David Gentleman and photogravure-printed by Harrison & Sons, each of the four low values also depicted a 16th-century set from one of Shakespeare’s plays.\nThe 3d had Puck cavorting round Bottom from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and the 6d showed Feste, the clown in Twelfth Night. The 1s 3d depicted the famous balcony scene from Romeo & Juliet, while the 1s 6d portrayed the King kneeling in prayer on the eve of Agincourt from Henry V. All the figures were reproduced from woodcuts.\nIn contrast, the 2s 6d was the first commemorative since the £1 Postal Union Congress stamp of 1929 to be line-engraved.\nDesigned by the brothers Robin and Christopher Ironside, and recess-printed by Bradbury Wilkinson, it showed Hamlet contemplating the skull of his father’s court jester, Yorick. This was the only stamp in the set to bear the name of the play.\nThree precedents\nQuestion:\nIn 1964, the first commoner featured on a British postage stamp was?\nAnswer:\nShakspeare\nPassage:\nForearm\nThe forearm refers to the region of the upper limb between the elbow and the wrist.  The term forearm is used in anatomy to distinguish it from the arm, a word which is most often used to describe the entire appendage of the upper limb, but which in anatomy, technically, means only the region of the upper arm, whereas the lower \"arm\" is called the forearm. It is homologous to the region of the leg that lies between the knee and the ankle joints, the crus.\n\nThe forearm contains two long bones, the radius and the ulna, forming the radioulnar joint. The interosseous membrane connects these bones. Ultimately, the forearm is covered by skin, the anterior surface usually being less hairy than the posterior surface.\n\nThe forearm contains many muscles, including the flexors and extensors of the digits, a flexor of the elbow (brachioradialis), and pronators and supinators that turn the hand to face down or upwards, respectively. In cross-section the forearm can be divided into two fascial compartments. The posterior compartment contains the extensors of the hands, which are supplied by the radial nerve. The anterior compartment contains the flexors, and is mainly supplied by the median nerve. The ulnar nerve also runs the length of the forearm.\n\nThe radial and ulnar arteries and their branches supply the blood to the forearm. These usually run on the anterior face of the radius and ulna down the whole forearm. The main superficial veins of the forearm are the cephalic, median antebrachial and the basilic vein. These veins can be used for cannularisation or venipuncture, although the cubital fossa is a preferred site for getting blood.\n\nAnatomy\n\nBones\n\n*radius\n*ulna\n\nJoints\n\n*proximal to forearm\n**elbow\n*in the forearm\n**proximal radioulnar joint\n**distal radioulnar joint\n*distal to forearm\n**wrist\n\nMuscles\n\n* \"E/I\" refers to \"extrinsic\" or \"intrinsic\". The intrinsic muscles of the forearm act on the forearm, meaning, across the elbow joint and the proximal and distal radioulnar joints (resulting in pronation or supination, whereas the extrinsic muscles act upon the hand and wrist. In most cases, the extrinsic anterior muscles are flexors, while the extrinsic posterior muscles are extensors.\n* The brachioradialis, flexor of the forearm, is unusual in that it is located in the posterior compartment, but it is actually in the anterior portion of the forearm.\n* The anconeus is considered by some as a part of the posterior compartment of the arm.\n\nNerves\n\n(See separate nerve articles for details on divisions proximal to the elbow and distal to the wrist; see Brachial plexus for the origins of the median, radial and ulnar nerves)\n*Median nerve – principle nerve of the anterior compartment (PT, FCR, PL, FDS).\n**anterior interosseous nerve (supplies FPL, lat. 1/2 of FDP, PQ).\n*Radial nerve – supplies muscles of the posterior compartment (ECRL, ECRB).\n**Superficial branch of radial nerve\n**Deep branch of radial nerve, becomes Posterior interosseus nerve and supplies muscles of the posterior compartment (ED, EDM, ECU, APL, EPB, EPL, EI).\n*Ulnar nerve - supplies some medial muscles (FCU, med. 1/2 of FDP).\n\nVessels\n\n*Brachial artery\n**Radial artery\n***Radial recurrent artery\n***dorsal metacarpal artery\n****Princeps pollicis artery\n**Ulnar artery\n***Anterior ulnar recurrent artery and posterior ulnar recurrent artery\n***Common interosseous artery\n****Posterior interosseous artery\n****Anterior interosseous artery\n\nOther structures\n\n*Interosseous membrane of forearm\n*Annular ligament of ulna\n\nFracture\n\nA fracture of the forearm can be classified as to whether it involves only the ulna (ulnar fracture), only the radius (radius fracture) or both (radioulnar fracture)\n\nAdditional images\nQuestion:\nWhich bone in the human forearm is slightly thicker than its pair?\nAnswer:\nRadius (geometry)\nPassage:\nTubou\nTubou is a village on the Fijian island of Lakeba.  One of eight villages on Lakeba, it is considered the capital of the Lau Islands, being the seat of the Vuanirewa clan, a powerful chiefly family from which Fiji's longtime Prime Minister and President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara (1920–2004) and one of Fiji's famous cricketers I.

The first official single \"Read All About It\" was released on 21 September 2011.  Some guests from his debut album appear on the album, including Ed Drewett, Fink and Emeli Sandé, New guests include Slaughterhouse and Bad Meets Evil member Royce da 5'9\", Kobe, Luciana, Ruth Anne, Sierra Kusterbeck and Haydon. Upper Clapton Dance originally featured on Green's debut mixtape Lecture #1,\nAs of 6 September 2014 the album has sold 280,000 copies in UK.\n\nBackground\n\nThe album's general theme is different, in that it is more emotional, to Professor Green's previous album; he had a difficult upbringing with a hard relationship with his parents. His father committed suicide in 2008 and it heavily affected him. Professor Green said of his father's suicide and upbringing that \"This album helped — writing about it was my way to deal with it.\"  The album, thus, is generally more emotional than his previous album, Alive Till I'm Dead, which covered more humorous themes. Ed Drewett and Emeli Sandé, who had previously worked on Alive Till I'm Dead, were featured on the album.\n\nSingles\n\n* \"At Your Inconvenience\" was released as the album's first promotional single on 26 July 2011. It was released via promotional single and digital download, and a music video was released in support of the track. The video features Green in various alter egos, performing the song in and around a bar. The track peaked at number 97 on the UK Singles Chart.\n* \"Read All About It\" was released as the album's first official single on 23 October 2011. The tracks features vocals from Emeli Sandé. On 5 September 2011, BBC Radio 1Xtra presenter MistaJam debuted the single, and gave it its first radio airplay. In promotion of the single, Green and Sande performed the song live on The X Factor results show on 23 October 2011. It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart.\n* \"Never Be a Right Time\" was released as the album's second official single on 22 January 2012. The single features guest vocals from Ed Drewett. A music video was created for the track, however, Drewett does not appear in the video. The video features Green agonising over his relationship with a girl. The track peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart.\n* \"How Many Moons\" was released as the album's second promotional single on 21 April 2012, in support of the fifth annual Record Store Day. The song is produced by Austrian duo Camo & Krooked. The remix (released as the single) features guest vocals from Dream Mclean and Rinse. A lyric video was created for the track, however, no official music video was filmed. The track was ineligible to chart, as only 1000 copies of the single were produced.\n* \"Remedy\" was released as the album's third official single on 3 June 2012. The single features guest vocals from Ruth-Anne Cunningham. The song was remixed for its release as a single. The track reached #18 on the UK Singles Chart. In support of the single, Green prepared and released his own brand of beer, entitled \"Professor Green's Remedy\".\n* \"Avalon\" was released as the album's fourth official single on 16 September 2012. The single features guest vocals from Sierra Kusterbeck. The song was once again remixed for its release as a single. A music video for the track was filmed during the first week of July. Kusterbeck made a guest appearance in the video.\n\nReception\n\nIn general, the album has received mixed reviews from music critics. However, RWD Magazine gave the album 4/5 stars and stated 'Introspective and reflective, this borders on emo-rap on occasions, while retaining edginess on the sonic side'. MTV UK gave the album a positive review stating 'From hip-hop, to UK garage influences, this slick LP really does have it all.' The Guardian awarded the album 3/5 stars, saying 'It's difficult to reconcile Green's more crass verses with his sentimental numbers; Astronaut's tale of innocent rape victim turned junkie sits uncomfortably next to all the phallus jokes and Eminem-style sadism of songs such as Into the Ground. It's a heavy, ambivalent confessional, but Green's precocious personality and distinctive flow manage to keep it fired up.'\n\nThe Independent were less positive, saying 'Having managed to parlay an association with Lily Allen into the semblance of a career, Professor Green punches above his weight on his second album' before stating 'Green's delivery is too Estuary-Eminem, scattershot hip-hop asperity snarled out with a mockney menace that is too secondhand to be effective' and the Evening Standard said 'At his best, as on the vitriolic Read All About It, he can still sound like the English Eminem. When the acoustic guitars come out, though, he's closer to Just Jack.' The BBC were also unimpressed, with the BBC saying that Green is basically just saying \"Please let me on The X Factor… I promise I won’t swear!\" and that you are left \"frankly, bemused and, increasingly, very, very bored\". The Evening Standard summed up the album by saying \"The good news is that if fame really is so tough Manderson won't have to suffer for long: another album like this and nobody will be listening.\" Uncut gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, summing it up as \"rather tiring\". Perhaps the most damning review of all though was The Daily Telegraphs 1 out of 5, claiming \"his rhymes are too often lewd brags or boneheaded non sequiturs\". Any Decent Music, the online review aggregator, finds the album awarded overall 4.3 out of 10.[http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/3852/Professor-Green-At-Your-Inconvenience.aspx At Your Inconvenience by Professor Green reviews | Any Decent Music]\n\nTrack listing\n\nCharts and certifications\n\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\nRelease history\nQuestion:\nHow many moons does the planet Mars have?\nAnswer:\n2\nPassage:\nDouglas Reeman\nDouglas Edward Reeman, born at Thames Ditton , is a British author who has written many historical fiction books on the Royal Navy, mainly set during either World War II or the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nReeman joined the Royal Navy in 1940, at the age of 16, and served during World War II and the Korean War. He eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant. In addition to being an author, Reeman has also taught the art of navigation for yachting and served as a technical advisor for films. Douglas married Canadian Kimberley Jordan in 1985.\n\nReeman's debut novel, A Prayer for the Ship was published in 1958. His pseudonym Alexander Kent was the name of a friend and naval officer who died during the Second World War.  Reeman is most famous for his series of Napoleonic naval stories, whose central character is Richard Bolitho, and, later, his nephew, Adam. He also wrote a series of novels about several generations of the Blackwood family who served in the Royal Marines from the 1850s to the 1970s, and a non-fiction account of his World War II experiences, D-Day: A Personal Reminiscence (1984).\n\nBibliography (with publication dates)\n\nWorld War II novels\n\nThe Blackwood Saga\n\naka The Royal Marines Saga\n*Badge of Glory (1982) (1st in plot sequence)\n*The First to Land (1984) (2nd)\n*The Horizon (1993) (3rd)\n*Dust on the Sea (1999) (4th)\n*Knife Edge (2004) (5th)\n\nOther settings\n\n*High Water (1959)\n*Send a Gunboat (1960)\n*The Hostile Shore (1962)\n*The Last Raider (1963)\n*Path of the Storm (1966)\n*The Deep Silence (1967)\n*The Greatest Enemy (1970)\n\nRichard Bolitho novels\n\n(written under the name Alexander Kent)\n*Richard Bolitho, Midshipman (1975)\n*Midshipman Bolitho and the 'Avenger'  (1978)\n*Band of Brothers (2005)\n*Stand into Danger (1980)\n*In Gallant Company (1977)\n*Sloop of War (1972)\n*To Glory We Steer (1968)\n*Command a King's Ship (1973)\n*Passage To Mutiny (1976)\n*With All Despatch (1988)\n*Form Line of Battle!

Its name comes from (Pagus) Medullicus, or \"country of the Medulli\", the local Celtic tribe. The region owes its economic success mainly to the production of red wine; it is home to around 1,500 vineyards.\n\nThe area also has pine forests and long sandy beaches. The Médoc's geography is not ideal for wine growing, with its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean resulting in a comparatively mild climate and high rainfall making rot a constant problem. It is generally believed that the nature of the region's wine derives from the soil; although the terrain is flat, excellent drainage is a necessity and the increased amount of gravel in the soil allows heat to be retained, encouraging ripening, and extensive root systems.\n\nViticulture\n\nWith the exception of Château Haut-Brion from Graves, all of the red wines in the 1855 Classification are from the Médoc. Many of the Médoc wines that are not in this classification were classified using the Cru Bourgeois system until 2007. Following legal challenges this category was abolished, and reintroduced in 2010 as an annual \"mark of quality\" depending on independent annual assessment.\nQuestion:\nMedoc is a wine region in which country?\nAnswer:\nLa Republique francaise\nPassage:\nMerlyn Lowther\nMerlyn Vivienne Lowther (born March 1954)  was Chief Cashier of the Bank of England for 1999  to 2003.

Under the law, virtually all male U.S. citizens, and male aliens living in the U.S., who are ages 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service .\nSince there is no draft currently in effect, and men are not being classified for service, disabled men, clergymen, and men who believe themselves to be conscientiously opposed to war must also register.\nPenalties for Failure to Register for the Draft\nMen who do not register could be prosecuted and, if convicted, fined up to $250,000 and/or serve up to five years in prison. In addition, men who fail to register with Selective Service before turning age 26, even if not prosecuted, will become ineligible for:\nStudent Financial Aid - including Pell Grants , College Work Study , Guaranteed Student/Plus Loans, and National Direct Student Loans .\nU.S. Citizenship - if the man first arrived in the U.S. before his 26th birthday.\nFederal Job Training - The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) offers programs that can train young men for jobs in auto mechanics and other skills. This program is only open to those men who register with Selective Service.\nFederal Jobs - men born after December 31, 1959, must be registered to be eligible for jobs in the Executive Branch of the Federal government and the U.S. Postal Service.\nIn addition, several states have added additional penalties for those who fail to register.\nYou may have read or been told that there is no need to register because so few people are prosecuted for failing to register. The goal of the Selective Service System is registration, not prosecution. Even though those who fail to register may not be prosecuted they will be denied student financial assistance , federal job training , and most federal employment unless they can provide convincing evidence to the agency providing the benefit they are seeking, that their failure to register was not knowing and willful.\nWho Does NOT Have to Register for the Draft?\nMen who are not required to register with Selective Service include;  nonimmigrant aliens in the U.S. on student, visitor, tourist, or diplomatic visas; men on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces ; and cadets and midshipmen in the Service Academies and certain other U.S. military colleges. All other men must register upon reaching age 18 (or before age 26, if entering and taking up residence in the U.S. when already older than 18).\nWhat About Women and the Draft?\nWhile women officers and enlisted personnel serve with distinction in the U.S. Armed Forces, women have never been subject to Selective Service registration or a military draft in America. For a complete explanation of the reasons for this, see,  Backgrounder: Women and the draft in America from the Selective Service System.\nWhat is the Draft and How Does it Work?\nThe \"draft\" is the actual process of calling men between ages 18 - 26 to be inducted to serve in the U.S. military. The draft is typically used only in the event of war or extreme national emergency as determined by the Congress and the president.\nShould the President and the Congress decide a draft was needed, a classification program would begin. Registrants would be examined to determine suitability for military service, and they would also have ample time to claim exemptions, deferments, or postponements. To be inducted, men would have to meet the physical, mental, and administrative standards established by the military services. Local Boards would meet in every community to determine exemptions and deferments for clergymen, ministerial students, and men who file claims for reclassification as conscientious objectors.\nMen have not actually been drafted into service since the end of the Vietnam War.\nHow Do You Register?\nThe easiest and fastest way to register with Selective Service is to register on-line .\nYou can also register by mail using a Selective Service \"mail-back\" registration form available at any U.S. Post Office. A man can fill it out, sign (leaving the space for your Social Security Number blank, if you have not yet obtained one), affix postage, and mail it to Selective Service, without the involvement of the postal clerk. Men living overseas may register at any U.S. Embassy or consular office.\nMany high school students can register at school. More than half the high schools in the United States have a staff member or teacher appointed as a Selective Service Registrar. These individuals help register male high school students.\nQuestion:\nWhat must nearly all American men register for at age 18?\nAnswer:\nConscription in the United States\nPassage:\nAlfred Chuang\nAlfred S.

It is Volume 10 in the original Tom Swift novel series published by Grosset & Dunlap. The novel is notable for inspiring the name of the Taser.\n\nPlot \n\nWhile Tom Swift is working on his latest new invention, the electric rifle, he meets an African safari master whose stories of elephant hunting sends the group off to deepest, darkest Africa. Hunting for ivory is the least of their worries, as they find out some old friends are being held hostage by the fearsome tribes of the red pygmies.\n\nSwift builds two major inventions in this volume. The first is a replacement airship, known as The Black Hawk. This new airship is to replace The Red Cloud, which was destroyed during his adventures in Tom Swift in the Caves of Ice. This airship is of the same general construction as The Red Cloud, but is smaller and more maneuverable.\n\nOf foremost notice is Swift's invention of the electric rifle, a gun which fires bolts of electricity. The electric rifle can be calibrated to different levels of range, intensity and lethality; it can shoot through solid walls without leaving a hole, and is powerful enough to kill a rampaging whale, as in their steamer trek to Africa. With the electric rifle, Tom and friends bring down elephants, rhinoceroses, and buffalo, and save their lives several times in pitched battle with the red pygmies. It also can discharge a globe of light that was described as being able to maintain itself, like ball lightning, making hunting at night much safer in the dark of Africa. In appearance, the rifle looked very much like contemporary conventional rifles.\n\nClaims of racism \n\nAlthough the book exists in a historical context, a modern reading reveals bold racism in the plot. \n\nHomages \n\nSixty years later a non-lethal weapon delivering an electric shock was developed by Jack Cover and marketed by Taser International under the name \"Taser\", an acronym for Thomas A. Swift's Electric Rifle. The middle initial 'A' is gratuitous to avoid \"TSER\", as no other name than \"Tom Swift\" is used for the book's hero.\nQuestion:\nWhat is Thomas A. Swift's Electric Rifle better known as?\nAnswer:\nTaser Gun\nPassage:\nVistula Lagoon\nThe Vistula Lagoon (;  or Kaliningradskiy Zaliv; ; ) is a brackish water lagoon on the Baltic Sea roughly 56 miles (90 km) long, 6 to 15 miles (10 to 19 km) wide, and up to 17 feet (5 m) deep, separated from Gdańsk Bay by the Vistula Spit. It is now known as the Vistula Bay or Vistula Gulf. The modern German name, Frisches Haff, is derived from an earlier form, Friesisches Haff.Erhard Riemann, Alfred Schoenfeldt, Ulrich Tolksdorf, Reinhard Goltz, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (Germany), Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz, Preussisches Wörterbuch: Deutsche Mundarten Ost- und Westpreussens, 6th edition, Wachholtz, 1974, p.595, ISBN 3-529-04611-6\n\nThe lagoon is a mouth of a few branches of the Vistula River, notably the Nogat, and the Pregolya River. It is connected to Gdańsk Bay by the Strait of Baltiysk.\n\nThe Poland–Russia border runs across the lagoon.\n\nLocalities on the lagoon include Kaliningrad, Baltiysk, and Primorsk in Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast and Elbląg, Tolkmicko, Frombork, Krynica Morska in Poland. The Polish port of Elbląg used to see a substantial amount of trading traffic on the lagoon, but that has declined owing to the current border situation. Kaliningrad and Baltiysk are currently major seaports on the lagoon.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe earliest version of the name of Vistula Lagoon has been recorded in historical sources by Wulfstan, an Anglo-Saxon sailor and merchant at the end of the 9th Century as Estmere.  It is an Anglo-Saxon translation of Old Prussian name for the lagoon - *Aīstinmari (modern Lithuanian - Aistmarės) derived from (OP - Old Prussian) Aistei - \"Ests\", (LAT - Latin)\"Aestii\" etc. and (OP) *mari - \"lagoon (a body of water cut off from a larger body by a reef of sand), fresh water bay\".  The Ests were Baltic people who since 9th Century became called in some historical sources (first time by Bavarian Geographer) Bruzi, Pruzzen, Pruteni etc. - Old Prussians. So the oldest known meaning of the name of Vistula Lagoon was \"The lagoon or sea of the Ests\". Over three hundred years later, in the first half of the 13th Century, the name of Vistula Lagoon occurs in deeds issued by Teutonic Order in Latin version as Mare Recens (1246 - \"mare\" - a pool or lake or sea and \"recens\" - fresh) in contrast to the contemporary name for the Baltic Sea - Mare Salsum (Salty Sea). Then in 1251 we find record about Mare Recens et Neriam (Frisches Haff and Frische Nehrung, now Vistula Spit) and finally in 1288 Recenti Mari Hab (Haff) which as one can see corresponds with later German \"Frisches Haff\" = \"Fresh Lagoon\". \n\nProposed Canal\n\nDigging a canal to connect the lagoon with the Baltic Sea is in consideration as a major EU-supported project. The canal, 1 km in length, would re-activate the Elbląg port. It would also free its dependence on Russia, which time and again revokes the right of passage for Polish ships through Strait of Baltiysk as a form of pressure on Polish authorities. It would cost an estimated PLN 800 million. However, major ecological considerations stand in the way. For example, mammal migration along the lagoon could be disrupted. Also, the inflow of brackish waters from the Baltic sea could result in serious unbalancing of the lagoon's freshwater ecosystem.\n\nHistory \n\nFrom 1772 until 1918, the lagoon was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which had become part of the German Empire in 1871. Between 1920 and 1946 it was split between Germany and the Free City of Danzig. At present state since 1945 its eastern part belongs to Russia (formerly USSR), Poland has 43.8% of its area at lagoon's western side. The bordering administrative regions is polish Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and modern Russian Kaliningrad Oblast, which had name Königsberg Oblast during half of 1946.\n\nKursenieki\n\nWhile today the Kursenieki, also known as Kuršininkai are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit, in 1649 Kuršininkai settlement spanned from Memel (Klaipėda) to Danzig (Gdańsk), including the area around the Vistula Lagoon. The Kuršininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kuršininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel, and other territories of East Prussia which would be later dropped.\n\nHistorical events related to lagoon \n\nFrom January until March 1945 throughout the Evacuation of East Prussia refugees from East Prussia crossed the frozen lagoon on their way to the west after the Red Army had reached the coast of the lagoon near Elbing on January 26. Attacked by Soviet fighter aircraft thousands of them were killed or broke through the ice.\nQuestion:\nThe Vistula Lagoon is a freshwater lagoon on which sea?\nAnswer:\nMare Suevicum\n\n\nPassage:\nSimple Simon (1935) - Plot Summary - IMDb\nSimple Simon (1935) - Plot Summary - IMDb\nSimple Simon (1935)\nPlot Summary\nShowing one plot summary\nAs in the nursery rhyme, Simple Simon meets a pieman on his way to the fair and samples his wares.
