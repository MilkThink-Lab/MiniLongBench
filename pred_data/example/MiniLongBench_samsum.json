Is it difficult? \r\nSheryl: Honestly, it was quite difficult in the beginning with the language because everything is in English, but because I did a foundation year abroad as well, and I learned academic English, I was already somehow more prepared for what was coming next\r\nRichelle: And what do you study?\r\nSheryl: I am in my 3rd year studying psychology !!\r\nRichelle: Seriously? That's what I want to study as well!\r\nSheryl: Oh that's great ahah, I really like the course and the way they assess us with the assignments, all the topics seem to be very interesting and you end up doing a lot of research. I am sure you will like it too\r\nRichelle: Cool! And what about people there? I'm asking because I am a bit shy 😞\r\nSheryl: Studying abroad is honestly a new world. You see people from different parts of the world, and the most exciting thing is that you actually have things in common with them. Although let me tell you you have to be very open minded\r\nRichelle: Have you had any unpleasant situations there?\r\nSheryl: Yes, I have, unfortunately, when you are abroad, you start thinking about things you probably have never thought about before, things like stereotypes ..\r\nRichelle: Wow... what happened?\r\nSheryl: I guess we, unconsciously, treat people differently or just make up our minds, even before we know them. But don't be scared, seriously! I was shy in my first days too, and I thought everyone looks very confident, but trust me everyone feels exactly like you in their first days\r\nRichelle: 🙂 I'm really afraid and exciting of going to study abroad. And please tell me, is the living expensive there?\r\nSheryl: I guess it is more expensive than in Portugal as we have pounds, but groceries have almost the same prices\r\nRichelle: Ok, thanks a lot! You helped me a lot! I will contact with you if I have any other questions! Enjoy your day!\nSummary: Richelle needs advice about studying in Scotland. Sheryl finds that the beginnings can be difficult because of English and that everyone is shy, believe in stereotypes, but later more open minded.

        "origin_prompt": "Summarize the dialogue into a few short sentences. The following are some examples.\n\nDialogue: Gloria: Hi Tony, meant to ask you about it for some time now. Will a possible Brexit affect your business?\r\nTony: In Britain the farce of Brexit looms over everything all day every day. It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.\r\nGloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.\r\nTony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.\r\nTony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I’m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\r\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\r\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\r\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick. I've always been out of pocket, no matter whether in Austria or France. And now with the pound going down the drain...\r\nGloria: We are hardly meeting any British tourists in Mexico now. One couple in Campeche the other day but they said they're attending a convention or sth.\r\nTony: That's what I mean. We'll be stewing in our own splendidly isolated sauce again.\r\nGloria: Don't worry. You can always visit us in Austria paying your pounds which we will then spend visiting you in England.\r\nTony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?\r\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\r\nTony: Definitely. Those morons voted \"for\" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.\r\nTony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.\r\nGloria: Hasn't it started yet?\r\nTony: Yes. I fear the worst.\r\nGloria: Oh Tony... So wretched....\nSummary: Tony's business will be affected by Brexit and both her and Gloria will never understand why people voted for it. It will also affect Tony's holiday plans. Gloria can hardly meet any British tourists in Mexico. Tony thinks the second referendum is an option.\nDialogue: Vicky: Can I ask a really big favour?\r\nGrant: Sure.\r\nVicky: Can I borrow 50 bucks until the end of the month?

I promise.\r\nGrant: Cross your heart and hope to die? ;-)\r\nVicky: Of course. LOL\r\nVicky: It's just that things have been really unsteady at work and I'm still waiting on all the invoices to be paid.\r\nGrant: You need better clients hun!\r\nVicky: If I could ditch all the ones I currently have I would... but money and all that. LOL\r\nGrant: What good are clients that don't pay?\r\nVicky: You're right but what can I do. Is what is.\nSummary: Grant will lend Vicky 50 dollars.

I though it would be a huge \"festa\"\r\nJohn: no, she invited really a little group of best friends\r\nFred: Ok, then it changes everything\r\nRebeca: why?\r\nFred: I though she invited just everybody, I didn't think we were actually chosen \r\nJohn: yes, like the apostles \r\nRachel: hahaha, indeed\nSummary: Fred doesn't want to go to the party, because he doesn't like being in a crowd.
